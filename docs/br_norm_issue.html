    <h1>Plotbot's Kitchen: Br_norm's Overenthusiastic Shopping Trip</h1>

    <p>We've made progress with Chef Plotbot, but there's a subtle issue with how one of our star sous-chefs, <code>Br_Norm</code>, sources ingredients for its special Parker-Spiral-Normalized Radial Magnetic Field dish. It's a bit like the sous-chef getting a bit too enthusiastic and asking for ingredients for the entire month when the customer only ordered a meal for today!</p>

    <h2>The Goal: Precision Cooking</h2>
    <p>When you ask for <code>mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm</code> for a specific day (let's call it <code>TRANGE_CURRENT_ORDER</code>), the <code>Br_Norm</code> sous-chef needs another ingredient, <code>Sun_Distance</code> (from the <code>Proton_Station</code>). Ideally, it should <em>only</em> ask for <code>Sun_Distance</code> for that <em>exact</em> <code>TRANGE_CURRENT_ORDER</code>.</p>

    <h2>The Current Process & The Hiccup</h2>
    <p>Let's trace what happens over two customer orders:</p>

    <h3>Order 1: Dish for Sept 28th (<code>TRANGE_1</code>)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You order <code>mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm</code> for <strong>Sept 28th</strong>.</li>
        <li>The <code>Mag_RTN_4SA_Station</code> (where <code>Br_Norm</code> works) gets its main <code>Br</code> (radial magnetic field) ingredients stocked specifically for <strong>Sept 28th</strong>. Its pantry (<code>self.datetime_array</code>) now contains dates for Sept 28th.</li>
        <li><code>Br_Norm</code> needs to cook. It looks at its station's pantry, sees Sept 28th, and correctly asks <code>GetData</code> (the Expediter) for <code>Sun_Distance</code> for <strong>Sept 28th</strong>.</li>
        <li><em>So far, so good! The dish is prepared using ingredients from the correct day.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Order 2: Dish for April 26th (<code>TRANGE_2</code>) - The Overzealous Shopping Starts!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You then order <code>mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm</code> for <strong>April 26th</strong> (a completely different date).</li>
        <li>The <code>Mag_RTN_4SA_Station</code> gets its <code>Br</code> ingredients updated for <strong>April 26th</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li>Its pantry (<code>self.datetime_array</code>) is <strong>merged</strong>. It now holds dates for <em>both</em> April 26th AND Sept 28th. This is normal; the station keeps all ingredients it has acquired.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>Br_Norm</code> needs to cook again (for the April 26th order).
            <ul>
                <li>It looks at its station's <em>entire</em> pantry (the merged <code>self.datetime_array</code>).</li>
                <li>It sees dates spanning from April 26th all the way to Sept 28th.</li>
                <li><strong class="problem-path">The Problem:</strong> Instead of asking for <code>Sun_Distance</code> <em>only</em> for April 26th (the current order), the <code>_calculate_br_norm</code> method currently derives a time range from the *entire span* of <code>self.datetime_array</code>. It effectively says, "I need <code>Sun_Distance</code> for <em>everything from April 26th to Sept 28th</em>!"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>GetData</code> (the Expediter) is then instructed to fetch <code>Sun_Distance</code> for this very wide, merged period. This is why your Jupyter Notebook tries to download many files if the dates are far apart.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Why the test passed but the notebook showed the problem:</strong></p>
        <p>The test used dates that were very close (Sept 26th and Sept 28th). So, when <code>_calculate_br_norm</code> asked for <code>Sun_Distance</code> for the "merged" range of Sept 26th-28th, this was a small request. The data was likely already downloaded or quick to get, and the final plot for the second call could still find its specific data within what <code>br_norm</code> calculated. The test passed because the data was *present*, not necessarily because it was fetched *optimally*.</p>
        <p>Your Jupyter notebook, with widely spaced dates, correctly revealed the inefficiency of this broad data request for the dependency.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Doesn't This Happen for Simple Ingredients (e.g., <code>proton.density</code>)?</h2>
    <p>When you ask Chef Plotbot for a simple ingredient like <code>proton.density</code> for <code>TRANGE_CURRENT_ORDER</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>GetData</code> is told explicitly to get <code>proton.density</code> for <code>TRANGE_CURRENT_ORDER</code>.</li>
        <li>The <code>Proton_Station</code> is stocked for that specific range.</li>
        <li>There's no intermediate calculation step within <code>proton.density</code> itself that looks at its entire history to decide a *new, broader time range* for fetching further sub-dependencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Crux of the Matter for <code>br_norm</code></h2>
    <p>The <code>_calculate_br_norm</code> method (<code>Br_Norm</code>'s recipe) is the one making the decision about the time range needed for its <code>Sun_Distance</code> ingredient. Currently, its logic is:
    <br><code>trange_for_sun_distance = get_full_extent_of_data_in(self.datetime_array)</code>
    </p>
    <p>And <code>self.datetime_array</code> at that station is the merged history from all previous updates.</p>

    <h2>What Needs to Change (Conceptually)</h2>
    <p>The <code>Br_Norm</code> sous-chef (the <code>_calculate_br_norm</code> method) needs a way to know the <em>specific</em> <code>TRANGE_CURRENT_ORDER</code> that the customer (and thus Chef Plotbot) is interested in *right now*. It shouldn't have to infer this from the total historical inventory of its parent <code>Mag_RTN_4SA_Station</code>. It needs to be told: "Cook this for <em>this specific period</em>, and therefore, only get your dependencies for <em>this specific period</em>."</p>
    <p>This ensures that even if the <code>Mag_RTN_4SA_Station</code> has data from many different customer orders, <code>Br_Norm</code> only performs a precise, targeted shopping trip for the ingredients it needs for the meal being prepared at that moment.</p>
