## Major Update: V3 Architecture Initialization

- **Objective**: Formally begin the transition to the Plotbot V3 modular architecture.
- **Actions Taken**:
    - Created a new git branch `v3-refactor` to house all development for the new architecture, ensuring the `main` branch remains stable.
    - Added comprehensive documentation outlining the vision, progress, and technical roadmap for the V3 refactor. This includes:
        - `docs/v3_refactor/hierarchical_modular_architecture.md`: The high-level vision for a universal data structure.
        - `docs/v3_refactor/file_organization_summary.md`: A summary of the initial file organization.
        - `plotbot_v3/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md`: The detailed, phased implementation plan.
    - Committed the existing `plotbot_v3` proof-of-concept, which successfully demonstrates the new metadata-driven approach with WIND data (Phase 1 of the roadmap).
    - **Design Refinement**: Based on colleague feedback, refined the hierarchical naming convention from a strict 5-level hierarchy (`mission.instrument.coordinate.resolution.variable`) to a more practical 4-level structure (`mission.instrument.product.variable`) that maps more directly to existing data product names. This makes the transition more intuitive for users while maintaining the benefits of hierarchical organization.
    - Created `pyspedas_exploration.ipynb` for interactive exploration of pyspedas missions, instruments, and data products using tab completion and help functions.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with Phase 2 of the V3 roadmap: building a generic CDF processing framework.

**Version**: v2.58
**Commit Message**: "v2.58 Docs: Add V3 architecture vision and roadmap"
