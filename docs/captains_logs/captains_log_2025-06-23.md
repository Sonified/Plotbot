## V3 Architecture Branch Created

- **Objective**: Preserve V3 architecture work while maintaining clean main branch for production development.

- **Actions Taken**:
    - Created new git branch `v3-refactor` to house all V3 modular architecture development
    - Successfully pushed comprehensive V3 documentation and proof-of-concept code to branch
    - Documentation includes:
        - `docs/v3_refactor/hierarchical_modular_architecture.md`: Universal hierarchical data structure vision
        - `plotbot_v3/docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md`: Detailed implementation roadmap
        - `plotbot_v3/docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.html`: Beautiful styled version of roadmap
        - Complete WIND magnetometer proof-of-concept using metadata-driven approach
    - Cleaned main branch by removing V3 development files (`plotbot_v3/`, `dynamic_class_test.py`, etc.)
    - Maintained clean separation between production (main) and experimental (v3-refactor) code

- **V3 Branch Details**:
    - **Branch**: `v3-refactor`
    - **Hash**: `c3da19b`
    - **Version**: v2.58
    - **Commit**: "v2.58 Docs: Add V3 architecture vision and roadmap"
    - **Status**: Complete architectural documentation and WIND POC preserved for future development

- **Decision**: Implement immediate WIND data support on main branch using existing V2 patterns while preserving V3 vision for future comprehensive refactor.

- **Next Steps**: Create WIND magnetometer class following PSP pattern to provide immediate solution for colleague's multi-server data needs.

**Main Branch Version**: v2.58
**Main Branch Commit**: "v2.58 Clean: Reset main branch and document V3 architecture branch"
