## Import Issue Resolution - Untracked Test Classes

### Issue Discovery
Colleague reported an import error when downloading the latest version of plotbot from GitHub. Investigation revealed a critical initialization problem in `plotbot/__init__.py`.

### Root Cause Analysis

**The Problem:**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC IMPORTS in __init__.py:
from .data_classes.custom_classes.test_version_1_5_multi import test_version_1_5_multi, test_version_1_5_multi_class
from .data_classes.custom_classes.test_version_1_5_single import test_version_1_5_single, test_version_1_5_single_class
```

**Why This Failed:**
- These test class files existed locally (untracked in git)
- Files were auto-generated during CDF development but never committed
- When colleague downloaded repo, files were missing → `ImportError`

**Git Status Showed:**
```
Untracked files:
	plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_multi.py
	plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_multi.pyi  
	plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_single.py
	plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_single.pyi
```

### Resolution Applied

**Step 1: Remove Problematic Imports**
- Edited `plotbot/__init__.py` to remove imports for untracked test classes
- Cleaned up duplicate entries in `__all__` list
- Removed duplicate custom class import sections

**Step 2: Delete Untracked Files**
- Removed `test_version_1_5_multi.py` and `.pyi` files
- Removed `test_version_1_5_single.py` and `.pyi` files
- These were test artifacts, not production code

**Step 3: Verification**
```bash
conda run -n plotbot_env python -c "import plotbot; print('✅ Plotbot imported successfully!')"
```
Result: ✅ **Import successful - issue resolved**

### Secondary Issue: Environment Confusion

**Initial Test Error:**
```bash
python -c "import plotbot"
# ❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cdflib'
```

**Explanation:**
- System python lacks plotbot dependencies
- Conda environment (`plotbot_env`) has all required packages
- `cdflib` is properly included in both `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml`
- No code issue - just testing in wrong environment

**Lesson Learned:**
Always test with proper environment when validating plotbot functionality.

### Files Modified

**`plotbot/__init__.py`:**
- Removed untracked test class imports  
- Cleaned duplicate `__all__` entries
- Maintained all legitimate custom CDF classes

**Files Deleted:**
- `plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_multi.py`
- `plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_multi.pyi`
- `plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_single.py`
- `plotbot/data_classes/custom_classes/test_version_1_5_single.pyi`

### Impact & Resolution

**Before Fix:**
- Fresh plotbot downloads failed with `ImportError`
- Untracked development artifacts breaking production imports
- Duplicate and inconsistent `__init__.py` configuration

**After Fix:**
- Clean plotbot import for all users
- Proper separation of development/test artifacts from production code
- Consistent auto-registration of legitimate custom CDF classes

**Status:** ✅ **Issue resolved - plotbot imports cleanly for all users**

**Next Steps:**
- Commit and push fix to ensure all users get working version
- Consider improving auto-generation to avoid future untracked import issues

### Stardust Test Suite Debugging Session

**Major Bug Encountered:** The `test_stardust.py` test suite was running extremely slowly, and several plots were showing "no data available".

**Debugging Process:**

1.  **Initial State:** The `main` branch was exhibiting the slow behavior.
2.  **Branching for Safety:** Created a new branch `buggy_testing_stardust` to preserve the problematic code (commit `cb76b6b`).
3.  **Bisecting Commits:** We systematically reverted to older commits to find the source of the issue:
    *   `d5a2610`: Still slow.
    *   `86d6bdc`: Still slow/broken.
    *   `5e92068`: Still slow/broken.
    *   `3eec066`: **Working version found!** The tests ran quickly and passed.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** A `git diff` between the last good commit (`3eec066`) and the first bad one (`5e92068`) revealed the culprit in `tests/test_stardust.py`:
    *   The global `STARDUST_TRANGE` variable was changed from a 1.5-hour interval to a 5-day interval to accommodate a new orbital data test.
    *   This change inadvertently forced all other tests in the suite to load and process a massive amount of data, causing the extreme slowdown.
5.  **The Fix:**
    *   Checked out the `buggy_testing_stardust` branch.
    *   Modified `tests/test_stardust.py` to restore the original, short `STARDUST_TRANGE`.
    *   Created a new, longer time range (`ORBIT_TEST_TRANGE`) specifically for the `test_stardust_psp_orbit_data` test.

**Current Status:**

The performance issue is resolved, but the test suite on the `buggy_testing_stardust` branch now reveals several underlying data loading issues that were likely masked by the `STARDUST_TRANGE` problem. The following tests are failing or showing "no data available":

*   `test_stardust_ham_fetch_and_validate`: Fails because HAM data isn't loading.
*   `test_stardust_wind_mfi`: Fails with an `IndexError`, indicating a data format problem.
*   Several other tests related to FITS, Alpha/Proton, and DFB data pass but show empty plots, indicating that data is not being correctly fetched or processed for the requested time ranges.

**Next Steps:**

Now that we have a stable and fast test environment, we need to investigate why these specific data products are failing to load. We will start by diffing the relevant data class files against the working version from commit `3eec066`.

**Resolution:**

The root cause was identified in `plotbot/data_classes/data_types.py`. The configurations for the original, battle-tested data types had been corrupted. The fix involved:

1.  Restoring the original, working configurations for all established data types.
2.  Preserving the new dynamic `add_cdf_data_types` function to ensure the new custom CDF loading system can function in parallel without interfering with the old system.

All tests in the `test_stardust.py` suite are now passing, and core functionality has been restored.

**Final Action:**

The `buggy_testing_stardust` branch, containing these fixes, will now be merged into `main` and pushed to the remote repository.
