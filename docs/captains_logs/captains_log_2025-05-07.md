## Bug Fix: Multiple Time Range Support in `save_data_snapshot`

- **Issue:** The `save_data_snapshot` function in `plotbot/data_snapshot.py` failed when using multiple time ranges via `trange_list` parameter. The test `test_advanced_snapshot_save` was failing because when saving data with multiple time ranges defined in `TEST_TRANGES_FOR_SAVE`, only the last time range's data was present in the final instance.

- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  1. In `save_data_snapshot`, when processing multiple time ranges using `trange_list`, each call to `plotbot_get_data` was overwriting the instance's data rather than merging it with previously loaded data.
  2. This happened because each time range was processed independently without accumulating data between iterations.
  3. Specifically, when iterating through time ranges, the global instance (e.g., `plotbot.mag_rtn`) was being reinitialized with only the current time range data, rather than having data merged from all time ranges.

- **Fix Implemented:**
  1. Modified the data loading process in `save_data_snapshot` to correctly accumulate data across multiple time ranges.
  2. Ensured consistent data length between `instance.time` and `instance.datetime_array` by properly synchronizing them after data merging operations.
  3. Improved handling of merged data to maintain internal consistency in data class instances.

- **Outcome:** The function now correctly accumulates data from all time ranges specified in `trange_list` before saving the snapshot. Tests confirm that data from all time ranges is properly included in the final snapshot.

## Push: v2.26

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_07_v2.26`
- **Commit Message:** `Fix: Multiple time range support in save_data_snapshot function (v2.26)`
- **Branch:** `data_cubby_refactor`
- **Git Hash:** c0a65b4 (copied to clipboard)

Summary: This push fixes a critical issue in the `save_data_snapshot` function where multiple time ranges specified in `trange_list` were not being properly accumulated. Only the last time range's data was being preserved in the final snapshot. The fix ensures that data from all specified time ranges is correctly merged before saving the snapshot, making multi-time-range snapshots work as expected.

## Elusive Test: test_advanced_snapshot_load_verify_plot

- The test **test_advanced_snapshot_load_verify_plot** - Loads complex snapshots; passes if the plot matches the original data - remains elusive. This may very well lead to a refactoring of some of the core logic before we can successfully push an update for this functionality. 

## Design Reflections & Next Steps on Snapshot Issue

- **Potential Improvements:** Discussed potential design refinements to address snapshot inconsistencies, including:
    - Explicit `merge_policy` options for `data_cubby.update_global_instance`/`stash` (e.g., 'overwrite', 'skip_if_covered').
    - Clearer guarantees/locations for internal data consistency checks (time vs datetime_array vs field lengths).
    - Options for snapshot content (e.g., `save_raw_only`).
    - Embedding relevant `data_tracker` state within snapshots.

- **Merge Logic Confidence:** The `test_cdf_datetime_merge.py` suite serves as a gold standard, indicating the core logic for merging `datetime64` arrays is likely correct.

- **int64 Refinement:** The `test_INT64_datetime_merge_2.py` suite refines this using int64 timestamps (closer to internal representation), but the core issue might not be the int64 conversion itself.

- **Hypothesis:** The `data_cubby` merging logic appears functional based on the merge tests. The inconsistency observed in the failing `test_advanced_snapshot_load_verify_plot` likely arises during the **snapshot save or load process**, potentially corrupting or losing state *after* the merge is complete but *before* or *during* pickling/unpickling.

- **Next Action:** Create a new test suite building upon `test_INT64_datetime_merge_2.py`. This suite will:
    1. Perform the validated int64-based merge of multiple data segments.
    2. **Save** the merged mock instance to a pickle file (`save_data_snapshot` equivalent).
    3. **Load** the instance back from the pickle file (`load_data_snapshot` equivalent).
    4. **Verify** the internal consistency and time range integrity of the **loaded** instance.
    This will directly test the snapshotting layer's impact on the merged data state.

## Push: v2.27
