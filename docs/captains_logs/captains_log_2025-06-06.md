## Changes and Updates

- **Enhanced Conda Installation Script Reliability:**
    - **Issue Identified:** User reported that `install_scripts/1_init_conda.sh` was hanging indefinitely when trying to connect to anaconda servers during the version check process.
    - **Root Cause:** The script used `conda search conda` command which could hang indefinitely on slow network connections or when anaconda servers were unresponsive. The script also used `ping anaconda.org` without timeout protection.
    - **Solution Implemented:** 
        - Added intelligent timeout protection for all network operations (5-second timeouts)
        - Implemented cross-platform timeout handling (supports both GNU `timeout` and macOS built-in ping timeouts)
        - Added smart error code detection with specific user guidance:
            - Exit code 1: No internet connection
            - Exit code 2: DNS resolution failed
            - Exit code 68: Host not found (commonly when disconnected)
            - Exit code 124: Actual network timeout
            - Other codes: Generic network/firewall issues
        - Enhanced error messages provide actionable guidance instead of generic "connection failed" messages
        - Script now fails fast (under 30 seconds total) instead of hanging indefinitely
        - Installation can proceed even when version checks fail due to network issues
    - **Testing:** Verified script works correctly with internet connection, without internet connection, and with various network failure scenarios
    - **Result:** Installation script is now much more robust and user-friendly, providing clear feedback about connectivity issues while allowing the installation process to continue

This improvement significantly enhances the user experience for Plotbot installation, especially for users with unstable internet connections or restrictive network environments.
