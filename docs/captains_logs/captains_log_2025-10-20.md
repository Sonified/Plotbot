## Version v3.68

**Commit Message:** `v3.68 fix: resolved circular import error caused by missing time_ver module`

### Summary of Changes:
- **Fixed Critical Bug:** Removed lines 473-474 in `plotbot/__init__.py` that attempted to import a non-existent `time_ver` module, which was causing a circular import error for users.
- **Added UTF-8 Encoding Declaration:** Added `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` at the top of `__init__.py` to properly handle Unicode characters (sparkle emojis) in comments.
- The `time_ver` import was unnecessary as version information is already handled by `__version__` and `__commit_message__` variables.

### Bug Details:
User's colleague reported: `ImportError: cannot import name 'time_ver' from partially initialized module 'plotbot' (most likely due to a circular import)`

Root cause: Lines 473-474 were trying to import a module that doesn't exist in the codebase:
```python
from . import time_ver
time_ver = time_ver.time_ver
```

This has been removed, allowing plotbot to import successfully.
