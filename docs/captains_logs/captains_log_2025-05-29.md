# Captain's Log - 2025-05-29

## Summary of Session

- **Data Download Test (`test_data_download_from_berkeley`) Fixes:**
    - Identified that the parameterized test was failing for `mag_RTN_4sa` because it was incorrectly trying to access a `.bx` component instead of a valid RTN component like `.br`.
    - Corrected the parameterization for `mag_RTN_4sa` in `tests/test_data_download.py` to use `br`.
    - The initial assertion logic in the test was based on checking the length of the data array in the `plot_manager_instance`. This proved unreliable as different plot types might have differently structured data (e.g., scalar, multi-dimensional) that doesn't respond well to a simple `len()` check, or where `len() == 0` doesn't mean plotting failed.
    - Refactored the test's assertion: The test now primarily verifies that the `plotbot()` call completes without error (implying plotting was successful) and that the expected data files were actually downloaded locally. This is done by a new helper function `verify_downloaded_files_exist`.
    - Updated the instructional comments at the top of `tests/test_data_download.py` to provide clearer guidance on running individual parameterized tests using the `-k` flag and their `test_id_suffix`.

- **Proton Data Loading Optimization (br_norm Dependency Fix - User-Provided Definitive Explanation):**
    - **The Core Problem:** The excessive loading of `proton.sun_dist_rsun` (a dependency for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`) occurred because `mag_rtn_4sa_class._current_operation_trange` was being set to `None`. This forced `_calculate_br_norm` (within `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`) to use its internal fallback logic, which derived the dependency time range from the wide, merged `self.datetime_array` of the `mag_rtn_4sa` instance, instead of the specific user-requested time range for the current operation.

    - **The Broken Chain (BEFORE THE FIX):**
        1.  **`plotbot_main.py`**: Called `get_data` with the correct user `trange`.
        2.  **`get_data.py`**: Called `data_cubby.update_global_instance`, correctly passing the `trange` as `original_requested_trange`.
        3.  **`data_cubby.py` (THE BUG):** In the `update_global_instance` method, when calling the specific data class's update method (e.g., for `mag_rtn_4sa`), the call was made *without* the `original_requested_trange` parameter:
            ```python
            # In data_cubby.py -> update_global_instance (Simplified representation of the problematic call path)
            global_instance.update(imported_data_obj)  # ❌ original_requested_trange was MISSING
            ```
        4.  **`mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()`**: Received `original_requested_trange` as `None` (its default value because it wasn't passed from `data_cubby.py`). This resulted in `self._current_operation_trange` being set to `None`.
        5.  **`_calculate_br_norm()` (in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`)**: Checked `self._current_operation_trange`, found it was `None`, and then executed its fallback logic, using the full `self.datetime_array` to fetch dependencies.

    - **The Exact Fix (The Change Made):**
        - The single most critical change was modifying the call within **`data_cubby.py`'s `update_global_instance` method** to correctly pass the `original_requested_trange` to the data class's `update` method.
            ```python
            # In data_cubby.py -> update_global_instance (Simplified representation of the FIXED call path)
            # The call was changed from:
            # global_instance.update(imported_data_obj)
            # TO (conceptual change, actual implementation involved a try-except block):
            global_instance.update(imported_data_obj, original_requested_trange=original_requested_trange)
            ```

    - **The Fixed Chain (AFTER THE FIX):**
        1.  **`plotbot_main.py` & `get_data.py`**: Remained the same, correctly passing `original_requested_trange`.
        2.  **`data_cubby.py` (FIXED):** The `update_global_instance` method was modified. The call to the data class's `update` method now includes `original_requested_trange`:
            ```python
            # Actual implementation in the fixed data_cubby.py:
            try:
                global_instance.update(imported_data_obj, original_requested_trange=original_requested_trange)
            except TypeError as te: # Handle classes not expecting original_requested_trange
                if "unexpected keyword argument" in str(te) or "takes" in str(te):
                    global_instance.update(imported_data_obj)
                else:
                    raise te
            ```
            For `mag_rtn_4sa` (which *does* accept `original_requested_trange`), this call now successfully goes through the `try` block, passing the parameter.
        3.  **`mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()`**: Now receives the correct `original_requested_trange` (e.g., the specific user trange like `['2023-09-29/00:00:00.000', '2023-09-29/23:59:59.999']`). This correctly sets `self._current_operation_trange`.
        4.  **`_calculate_br_norm()` (in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`)**: Now finds `self._current_operation_trange` populated with the specific user trange. The condition `if hasattr(self, '_current_operation_trange') and self._current_operation_trange is not None:` becomes true, and `trange_for_dependencies` is set to this specific, narrow range. The problematic internal fallback in `_calculate_br_norm` is no longer reached for this reason.

    - **Secondary Improvement (Robustness in `_calculate_br_norm`):** Independently, the internal fallback logic within `_calculate_br_norm` (the one that used `self.datetime_array`) was also removed. This makes `_calculate_br_norm` more robust: if `_current_operation_trange` were `None`, an error occurs rather than incorrect data loading.

- **Data Download Midnight Handling:**
    - Corrected logic in `plotbot/data_download_berkeley.py` to ensure that requests ending at midnight (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00') correctly adjust the end time to the very end of the previous day (23:59:59.999999). This prevents missing the last segment of data for the intended final day or incorrectly starting to look for data on the specified midnight day itself.

- **Repository Cleanup:**
    - Moved large notebook file `Eall_ham_v0.ipynb` to the `local_tests_and_utils/` directory, which is gitignored. This prevents the file from being tracked and included in the main repository, reducing clone/download size for other users.

## Issues Encountered & Debugging

- **Excessive Data Loading for `br_norm` Dependencies (User-Provided Definitive Root Cause & Resolution):**
    - **Problem:** `proton.sun_dist_rsun` (dependency for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`) was loaded for wider time ranges than the specific user request.
    - **Definitive Cause:** The primary bug was in `plotbot/data_cubby.py`'s `update_global_instance` method. In the execution path relevant to `mag_rtn_4sa`, the call to `global_instance.update()` was previously made *without* passing the `original_requested_trange` parameter. This caused `mag_rtn_4sa_class._current_operation_trange` to be `None`.
    - Consequently, `_calculate_br_norm` in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`, finding `_current_operation_trange` as `None`, would trigger its own internal fallback logic, deriving a wide dependency time range from the `mag_rtn_4sa` instance's full (potentially merged) `datetime_array`.
    - **Resolution:**
        1.  **Corrected `data_cubby.py`:** The call `global_instance.update()` within `data_cubby.py` was modified to correctly pass `original_requested_trange=original_requested_trange`. This was implemented within a `try-except TypeError` block to also gracefully handle other data classes that might not (yet) accept this new parameter. For `mag_rtn_4sa`, this ensures it receives the specific `trange`.
        2.  **Strengthened `_calculate_br_norm()`:** The internal fallback logic within `_calculate_br_norm` (which used `self.datetime_array`) was removed. This ensures that if `_current_operation_trange` is `None`, an error occurs rather than incorrect data loading.

## Next Steps

- Ensure the `try-except TypeError` block in `data_cubby.py` correctly handles all data classes, allowing those that expect `original_requested_trange` to receive it, and those that don't to update via the fallback without error.
- Confirm `mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()` and other relevant classes correctly process the passed `original_requested_trange`.
- Maintain test coverage for non-contiguous time ranges and `br_norm` calculations.
