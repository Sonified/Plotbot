## Feature Development: Testing Br Normalization Calculation

- **Summary:** Developed comprehensive tests for calculating the normalized radial magnetic field (Br*R²). This critical solar physics parameter accounts for the 1/r² decrease of the magnetic field strength with distance from the Sun, allowing for meaningful comparisons between measurements at different solar distances.

- **Test Implementation Details:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_calculation.py` with multiple test cases:
        - Short timerange test (6-hour window)
        - Long timerange test (24-hour window)
        - Extended timerange test (6-day window)
        - Comparison between magnetometer types (mag_rtn_4sa vs mag_rtn)
    - Validated the formula: `Br_norm = Br * ((Rsun / 215.032867644)²)`
    - Confirmed the formula works with both high-resolution (4sa) and standard magnetometer data
    - Implemented a solar radius to AU conversion factor with appropriate precision (215.032867644)
    - Validated interpolation function for mapping Sun distance data to magnetometer timeline when data have different cadences

- **Implementation Testing Strategy:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py` to test key implementation patterns:
        - Lazy loading: Ensuring br_norm is only calculated when specifically requested
        - Dependency resolution: Testing cross-class dependency between mag and proton classes
        - Error handling: Graceful degradation when proton data isn't available
        - Calculation reuse: Verified that calculated values are properly cached and reused

- **Implementation Plan:**
    - Add `br_norm` calculation to `mag_rtn_4sa` and `mag_rtn` classes
    - Use lazy loading through `__getattr__` to trigger calculation only when requested
    - Ensure proper plotting options for visualizing the normalized field
    - Handle error cases when proton data isn't available
    - Document the approach in code comments for future maintenance

- **Scientific Insights:**
    - The normalized values typically range from -3 to +3 nT·AU²
    - This isn't a statistical normalization, but a physical correction accounting for radial distance effects
    - Sign changes (negative to positive) properly represent field polarity changes

## Development Status Investigation

- **Codebase Analysis:**
    - Found `test_psp_mag_br_norm.py` which expects br_norm to exist and work
    - However, the `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` file doesn't currently implement br_norm
    - The class' `__getattr__` method has a quirk: it prints a friendly error message but doesn't raise an AttributeError
    - This causes `hasattr(mag_rtn_4sa, 'br_norm')` to return True even though br_norm isn't implemented
    - Confirmed the `proton` class already has the `sun_dist_rsun` data we need for the br_norm calculation:
        - The value is properly initialized in the proton raw_data dictionary
        - It's calculated from SUN_DIST data during calculate_variables()
        - A plot_manager is created with appropriate plotting options

- **Additional Insights:**
    - The `proton` class converts spacecraft distance directly from kilometers to solar radii (dividing by 695700.0)
    - This conversion happens at data loading time, not at calculation time
    - While unusual to not store the raw value, this was an intentional design choice per the comment "Added from Jaye's version"
    - The friendly error handling in `__getattr__` improves user experience but creates unexpected behavior for testing
    - Our test approach is split between:
        - `test_br_norm_calculation.py`: Uses REAL data through the full processing chain
        - `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py`: Uses mocks to verify the class behavior patterns would work correctly

- **Detailed Implementation Plan:**
    1. **Update mag_rtn_4sa Class:**
       - Add `'br_norm': None` to raw_data initialization in __init__
       - Extend __getattr__ to handle special case for br_norm, triggering calculation when requested
       - Implement _calculate_br_norm method to:
         - Check if br data exists
         - Get proton sun_dist_rsun data if not already loaded
         - Interpolate sun distance to match mag timeline
         - Calculate br_norm using the validated formula
         - Store result in raw_data['br_norm']

    2. **Add Plot Options:**
       - Add plot_manager for br_norm in set_ploptions method
       - Use appropriate visualization parameters:
         - Y-label: 'Br·R² [nT·AU²]'
         - Legend: '$B_R \cdot R^2$'
         - Color: Different from br (e.g., 'darkorange')
         - Scale: 'linear'

    3. **Error Handling:**
       - Add robust error checking in _calculate_br_norm
       - Handle cases when proton data isn't available
       - Return NaN array for br_norm when calculation isn't possible
       - Add clear debug messaging

    4. **Documentation:**
       - Add docstrings explaining the physical significance of br_norm
       - Document dependencies on proton.sun_dist_rsun
       - Add formulas and conversion factors in comments

## Implementation Progress and Issues

- **Circular Import Fix:**
   - Identified circular import issue between data_cubby.py and psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py
   - Fixed by removing the global import of get_data in psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py and keeping it in the _calculate_br_norm method
   - This allows the tests to run without import errors

- **Data Loading Issue:**
   - Testing revealed a new issue with the `test_real_world_implementation()` test in `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py`
   - Error: `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` at line 283 when trying to access `len(proton_datetime)`
   - Discovered an inconsistent data state where `proton.sun_dist_rsun.data` is available but `proton.datetime_array` is None
   - This suggests the proton data is only partially loaded, which needs to be fixed for br_norm calculation to work properly
   - The proton class may need to ensure datetime_array is properly set when sun_dist_rsun data is loaded

## Push: v2.39

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_18_v2.39`
- **Commit Message:** `Feature: Document implementation plan for br_norm calculation (v2.39)`
- **Git Hash:** `b3198d0`
- **Summary:** Added detailed analysis of the codebase structure and a comprehensive implementation plan for the br_norm calculation feature. Discovered key insights about the proton class's sun distance data handling and the magnetometer class's attribute resolution behavior that will inform our implementation approach.
