## Feature Development: Testing Br Normalization Calculation

- **Summary:** Developed comprehensive tests for calculating the normalized radial magnetic field (Br*R²). This critical solar physics parameter accounts for the 1/r² decrease of the magnetic field strength with distance from the Sun, allowing for meaningful comparisons between measurements at different solar distances.

- **Test Implementation Details:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_calculation.py` with multiple test cases:
        - Short timerange test (6-hour window)
        - Long timerange test (24-hour window)
        - Extended timerange test (6-day window)
        - Comparison between magnetometer types (mag_rtn_4sa vs mag_rtn)
    - Validated the formula: `Br_norm = Br * ((Rsun / 215.032867644)²)`
    - Confirmed the formula works with both high-resolution (4sa) and standard magnetometer data
    - Implemented a solar radius to AU conversion factor with appropriate precision (215.032867644)
    - Validated interpolation function for mapping Sun distance data to magnetometer timeline when data have different cadences

- **Implementation Testing Strategy:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py` to test key implementation patterns:
        - Lazy loading: Ensuring br_norm is only calculated when specifically requested
        - Dependency resolution: Testing cross-class dependency between mag and proton classes
        - Error handling: Graceful degradation when proton data isn't available
        - Calculation reuse: Verified that calculated values are properly cached and reused

- **Implementation Plan:**
    - Add `br_norm` calculation to `mag_rtn_4sa` and `mag_rtn` classes
    - Use lazy loading through `__getattr__` to trigger calculation only when requested
    - Ensure proper plotting options for visualizing the normalized field
    - Handle error cases when proton data isn't available
    - Document the approach in code comments for future maintenance

- **Scientific Insights:**
    - The normalized values typically range from -3 to +3 nT·AU²
    - This isn't a statistical normalization, but a physical correction accounting for radial distance effects
    - Sign changes (negative to positive) properly represent field polarity changes

## Push: v2.38

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_18_v2.38`
- **Commit Message:** `Feature: Testing implementation of br_norm calculation (v2.38)`
- **Summary:** Added comprehensive tests for calculating the normalized radial magnetic field (br_norm). Created both functional and implementation pattern tests to ensure cross-class dependencies are handled properly and calculations are performed only when needed.
