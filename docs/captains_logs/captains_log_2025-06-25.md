## Git Crisis Resolution and Repository Cleanup

### Major Issue Encountered
**Problem**: Massive git push failure due to accidentally committed 24GB PSP archive data
- Git was trying to push 1,449 objects instead of expected small changes
- Push was hanging indefinitely trying to upload massive CDF files
- Archive files (`psp_data_ARCHIVE_DELETE/`) were accidentally committed in git history

### Solution Implemented
**Used `git filter-branch` to surgically remove archive files from history**:
```bash
FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1 git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch psp_data_ARCHIVE_DELETE' HEAD~3..HEAD
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Successful push: Only 30 objects instead of 1,449
- ✅ All migration work preserved (README, config, test files)
- ✅ Git history intact: All 173 commits maintained
- ✅ Only removed unwanted archive files from last 3 commits

### Version Management
**Current Version**: v2.60
- **Commit Hash**: c974712
- **Commit Message**: "v2.60 Migration: Complete PSP data path migration to unified data/psp structure"
- **Date**: 2025-06-25

### PSP Data Migration - Final Status
**COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** ✅
- All PSP data types migrated from `psp_data/` to `data/psp/`
- PySpedas configuration fixed to use unified structure
- All test files updated with correct paths
- 24GB+ of data successfully migrated using rsync
- Repository clean and properly pushed to GitHub

### Learning Notes
- `git filter-branch` is powerful for removing unwanted files from history
- Always check git status before committing large data files
- Filter-branch rewrites commit hashes but preserves actual history
- Multiple commits can represent the same logical work unit

## WIND Data Integration Planning

### Comprehensive Integration Plan Created
**Deliverable**: `docs/implementation_plans/wind_integration_plan.md`

**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Analyzed PSP/WIND data product overlap (~80% reusable styling)
- ✅ Identified magnetic field, proton moments, electron data similarities  
- ✅ Planned non-breaking integration approach (existing PSP names unchanged)
- ✅ Designed unified data types file structure
- ✅ Outlined 4-phase implementation timeline
- ✅ Considered v3.0 transition pathway using WIND as testbed

**Architecture Decision**: Maintain existing PSP class names (`mag_rtn_4sa`, `proton`, `epad`) while adding new WIND classes with `wind_` prefix. This avoids massive breaking changes while enabling quick integration.

**Next Implementation Steps**: 
1. Rename `psp_data_types.py` → `data_types.py` (8 import changes)
2. Add WIND data type configurations  
3. Create WIND data classes following PSP patterns
4. Test mixed PSP/WIND plotting workflows

### Version Management
**New Version**: v2.61
- **Commit Message**: "v2.61 Planning: Add comprehensive WIND data integration plan with PSP styling reuse analysis"
- **Date**: 2025-06-25

**Next Steps**: Begin implementation of WIND integration plan when ready for multi-satellite support.
