## Bug Fix: DataCubby Merge Logic for Disjoint Ranges

**Symptom:** When using `multiplot` with multiple time ranges, only the first panel's data was correctly loaded and plotted. Subsequent panels failed because the `DataCubby` incorrectly determined that the new time ranges (e.g., 2019) were already contained within the existing data (e.g., 2018 + 2021-2025).

**Root Cause:** The `_merge_arrays` method in `data_cubby.py` calculated the overall start and end times of the data already in the cubby. It then checked if the *new* time range fell within this overall span. This logic failed when the existing data had gaps (disjoint ranges), leading it to incorrectly conclude the new data was already present.

**Fix:** Modified `_merge_arrays` to:
1. Combine existing and new time arrays.
2. Find unique timestamps using `np.unique`.
3. Compare the count of unique timestamps to the original count of existing timestamps.
4. Only proceed with the merge if the unique count is *greater*, indicating that the new data adds genuinely new time points.

This ensures that data is merged correctly even when the cubby contains disjoint time ranges.

## Push: v2.06

- Version: 2025_05_05_v2.06
- Commit message: Fix: Correct DataCubby merge logic for disjoint time ranges (v2.06) 

## Feature Complete: Degrees-from-Perihelion Axis

- The degrees-from-perihelion axis is now fully implemented and matches the Carrington longitude axis in all formatting and behavior (ticks, labels, wrap-around, etc.).
- Implementation strictly mirrors the Carrington longitude logic, with a longitude shift so 0Â° aligns with perihelion.
- Axis formatting now uses a robust flag (`panel_actually_uses_degrees`) to ensure correct degree formatting.
- All relevant tests pass (see `tests/test_degrees_from_perihelion.py`).
- See updated implementation plan in `docs/implementation_plans/perihelion_axis_plan_v2.md` for details and lessons learned.

## Push: v2.11

- Version: 2025_05_05_v2.11
- Commit message: v2.11: Degrees-from-perihelion axis complete, matches Carrington longitude logic

Summary: Perihelion axis feature is now complete, fully matching Carrington longitude axis formatting and behavior. All tests pass. See implementation plan and above for details.
