## Bug Fix: DataCubby Merge Logic for Disjoint Ranges

**Symptom:** When using `multiplot` with multiple time ranges, only the first panel's data was correctly loaded and plotted. Subsequent panels failed because the `DataCubby` incorrectly determined that the new time ranges (e.g., 2019) were already contained within the existing data (e.g., 2018 + 2021-2025).

**Root Cause:** The `_merge_arrays` method in `data_cubby.py` calculated the overall start and end times of the data already in the cubby. It then checked if the *new* time range fell within this overall span. This logic failed when the existing data had gaps (disjoint ranges), leading it to incorrectly conclude the new data was already present.

**Fix:** Modified `_merge_arrays` to:
1. Combine existing and new time arrays.
2. Find unique timestamps using `np.unique`.
3. Compare the count of unique timestamps to the original count of existing timestamps.
4. Only proceed with the merge if the unique count is *greater*, indicating that the new data adds genuinely new time points.

This ensures that data is merged correctly even when the cubby contains disjoint time ranges.

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Multiplot Modifications & Code Discrepancy (Degrees from Perihelion)

**Objective:** Implement a new x-axis mode for `multiplot` showing degrees relative to perihelion longitude.

**Steps Taken:**
- Added perihelion time lookup functions to `utils.py`.
- Added new options (`use_degrees_from_perihelion`, `degrees_from_perihelion_range`, `degrees_from_perihelion_tick_step`, `tight_x_axis`) to `multiplot_options.py` (including stubs).
- Attempted numerous automated edits (`edit_file`) to modify `multiplot.py` to:
    - Calculate relative degrees using `calculate_degrees_from_perihelion`.
    - Align plotted data with calculated degrees using `pd.merge_asof`.
    - Add final axis formatting logic for the new mode.
    - Implement the `tight_x_axis` option.

**Problem:** Encountered a series of runtime errors (`ImportError`, `AttributeError`, `ValueError`, `UnboundLocalError`). While attempting to debug and fix these, particularly by inserting debug prints, it became apparent that the AI's internal representation of `plotbot/multiplot.py` may not match the actual file state. The user (Robert) reported that code structures referenced by the AI did not exist in his file.

**Additional Symptom:** User reports that plots generated using `use_degrees_from_perihelion=True` incorrectly display "Time" on the x-axis, while `x_axis_carrington_lon=True` functions correctly.

**Current Status:** High level of concern regarding the integrity of the recent modifications to `multiplot.py`. Trust has been eroded due to apparent code hallucination and persistent errors.

**Immediate Next Step:** Perform a full read of `plotbot/multiplot.py` to establish an accurate baseline of the code before proceeding with any further modifications or debugging for the "degrees from perihelion" feature.

## Extended Diagnosis & Debug Plan: Degrees from Perihelion Axis Failure (2025-05-05 Cont.)

**Macro Goal:** Implement a user-selectable x-axis mode in `multiplot` that displays Carrington longitude relative to the longitude at the specific perihelion time for the encounter corresponding to each panel's center time. Zero degrees should represent the perihelion longitude.

**Micro Goal (Current):** Debug why setting `plt.options.use_degrees_from_perihelion = True` results in the x-axis defaulting to "Time" instead of showing "Degrees from Perihelion (Â°)", even though the related `plt.options.x_axis_carrington_lon = True` setting *does* correctly display longitude.

**History & Problems Encountered:**
1.  **Initial Implementation:** Added `PERIHELION_TIMES` dict and `get_perihelion_time` function to `utils.py`. Added new options (`use_degrees_from_perihelion`, range/tick options, `tight_x_axis`) to `multiplot_options.py` and `.pyi`.
2.  **`multiplot.py` Modification:** Attempted extensive modifications to `multiplot.py` via multiple `edit_file` calls to:
    *   Determine the axis mode based on options.
    *   Call `calculate_degrees_from_perihelion` from `utils.py`.
    *   Implement data alignment using `pd.merge_asof` between calculated degrees (and their corresponding times) and the original data slice.
    *   Add logic to the final axis formatting loop to handle ticks, labels, and limits for the new degree mode.
    *   Add logic for the `tight_x_axis` option.
3.  **Runtime Errors:** Encountered and fixed a series of errors:
    *   `ImportError` for `apply_right_axis_color` (removed import/call).
    *   `ImportError` for `ensure_datetime_objects` (replaced usage with `pd.to_datetime`, removed import).
    *   `AttributeError` for setting read-only properties (`using_positional_x_axis`, `active_positional_data_type`) (removed incorrect assignments).
    *   `ValueError` for ambiguous array truthiness (changed `if ham_var:` to `if ham_var is not None:`).
    *   `UnboundLocalError` for `panel_actually_uses_degrees` (initialized variable at start of loop).
4.  **Code Discrepancy/Hallucination:** During debugging, AI referenced code structures in `multiplot.py` that did not match the user's actual file, indicating a desynchronization or internal error. This necessitated reading the full file to re-establish a baseline.
5.  **Current Failure:** Despite resolving the explicit errors, setting `use_degrees_from_perihelion = True` still results in the x-axis being labeled "Time".

**Current Hypothesis & Potential Causes:**
The fallback to the "Time" axis suggests that the logic flow for the degrees-from-perihelion mode is failing at some point *before* the final axis formatting stage. Specifically:
*   **Failure Point 1: Perihelion Time Lookup:** The `get_perihelion_time(center_time)` call might be returning `None` for the 2025 dates used in the test, likely because the `PERIHELION_TIMES` dictionary in `utils.py` lacks entries for these future encounters. If `perihelion_time_str` is `None`, the `current_panel_use_degrees` flag is never set to `True`.
*   **Failure Point 2: Calculation:** The `calculate_degrees_from_perihelion(...)` function might be returning `None` or an array of all `NaN`s for the `relative_degrees`. This could happen if the underlying positional data file (`Parker_positional_data.npz`) does not contain trajectory data covering the requested time range (March 2025) or the (missing) perihelion time.
*   **Failure Point 3: Data Alignment:** The `pd.merge_asof(...)` call might fail to align the calculated `relative_degrees` with the original `data_slice`, resulting in an empty `merged_df`. This would trigger the fallback logic.
*   **Failure Point 4: Final Check (Less Likely):** The heuristic check in the final formatting loop (checking if plotted data *looks* like degrees) might incorrectly classify the data as non-degree-like, forcing a fallback to Time formatting. However, this usually only happens if one of the previous failure points occurred.

**Debugging Plan:**
To pinpoint the failure, we need to trace the execution path and intermediate values within the `multiplot.py` main loop, specifically for the plot type being used (likely `time_series` for `mag_rtn_4sa.br`).

**Action:** Insert targeted `print_manager.debug` statements inside the `if var.plot_type == 'time_series':` block, within the `if current_panel_use_degrees and perihelion_time_str:` condition.

1.  **Debug Print 1 (After Calculation):** Verify the output of `calculate_degrees_from_perihelion`.
    *   *Location:* Immediately after the line `output_times, relative_degrees = calculate_degrees_from_perihelion(...)` (approx. line 740).
    *   *Code:* 
    ```python
                                           # <<< DEBUG PRINT 1 >>>
                                           print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - perihelion_time_str: {perihelion_time_str}") # Also print the perihelion time used
                                           print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - output_times type: {type(output_times)}, len: {len(output_times) if output_times is not None else 'None'}")
                                           print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - relative_degrees type: {type(relative_degrees)}, len: {len(relative_degrees) if relative_degrees is not None else 'None'}")
                                           if relative_degrees is not None and len(relative_degrees) > 0:
                                               print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - degrees range: {np.nanmin(relative_degrees):.2f} to {np.nanmax(relative_degrees):.2f} (NaNs: {np.isnan(relative_degrees).sum()})")
                                           elif relative_degrees is None:
                                                print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - relative_degrees is None")
                                           else: # Empty array
                                                print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Calc Output - relative_degrees is empty")
                                           # <<< END DEBUG PRINT 1 >>>
    ```

2.  **Debug Print 2 (After Alignment):** Verify the result of the `pd.merge_asof` alignment.
    *   *Location:* Immediately after the line `merged_df.dropna(subset=['data', 'x_data'], inplace=True)` (approx. line 755).
    *   *Code:*
    ```python
                                               # <<< DEBUG PRINT 2 >>>
                                               print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Merge Output - merged_df shape: {merged_df.shape}")
                                               if not merged_df.empty:
                                                   print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Merge Output - Final x_data type: {type(merged_df['x_data'].values)}, len: {len(merged_df['x_data'].values)}")
                                                   print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Merge Output - Final x_data range: {np.nanmin(merged_df['x_data'].values):.2f} to {np.nanmax(merged_df['x_data'].values):.2f}")
                                                   # Check panel_actually_uses_degrees status AFTER merge logic
                                                   print_manager.debug(f"Panel {i+1} Merge Output - panel_actually_uses_degrees flag: {panel_actually_uses_degrees}") 
                                               # <<< END DEBUG PRINT 2 >>>
    ```

**Next Steps:**
1.  Manually insert the debug print code blocks specified above into `plotbot/multiplot.py` at the indicated locations.
2.  Ensure `print_manager.show_debug = True` is set.
3.  Rerun the test script from `Examples_Multiplot.ipynb` that uses `plt.options.use_degrees_from_perihelion = True`.
4.  Analyze the debug output to identify where the process is failing or falling back to the time axis.

## Push: v2.07

- **Version:** 2025_05_05_v2.07
- **Commit message:** feat: Implement degrees from perihelion axis attempt & fixes (v2.07)

**Summary:** Pushing current state after numerous attempts to implement and debug the 'degrees from perihelion' feature in multiplot. This includes fixes for various runtime errors and additions to options/utils. The feature is still not fully working (defaults to Time axis). Next step is to analyze debug output from prints added in `multiplot.py`.

## Refactoring Plan: Degrees from Perihelion Axis

**Problem:** Implementation of the `use_degrees_from_perihelion` x-axis became overly complex, deviating from the simpler, working pattern established by `x_axis_carrington_lon`. This led to unexpected behavior (e.g., incorrect axis labels) and difficult debugging.

**Decision:** Revert the complex additions (like `utils.calculate_degrees_from_perihelion` and associated merge logic in `multiplot.py`) and refactor the feature following a clean plan.

**New Plan:** Documented in `docs/implementation_plans/perihelion_axis_plan_v2.md`. The core strategy is to treat the perihelion axis as a direct variation of the Carrington longitude axis, leveraging existing positional mapping and degree formatting logic within `multiplot.py` and `XAxisPositionalDataMapper`.

## Push: v2.08

- **Version:** 2025_05_05_v2.08
- **Commit message:** refactor: Clean plan for degrees from perihelion axis (v2.08)

**Summary:** Pushing the refined implementation plan (`perihelion_axis_plan_v2.md`) and updated version information before proceeding with the refactoring.
