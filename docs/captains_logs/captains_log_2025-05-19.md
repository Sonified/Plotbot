# Captain's Log - 2025-05-19

## Session Start

**Goal:** Assist Robert with understanding the data update flow in Plotbot and document it.

## Key Activities & Learnings:

1.  **Data Update Flow Documentation:**
    *   Robert requested a more user-friendly explanation of Plotbot's data update mechanism, particularly focusing on the roles of `get_data`, `global_tracker`, `DataCubby`, and how calculated properties are handled.
    *   Used the metaphor of "Plotbot's Kitchen" with a Chef, ingredients, pantry, prep cooks, and a quartermaster (DataCubby) to make the explanation more approachable.
    *   Initially planned to create a Markdown file, but per Robert's preference, directly generated an HTML file: `docs/data_update_flow_explained.html`.
    *   This HTML file includes basic styling to improve readability.

## Git Push Details:

*   **Version:** `2025_05_18_v2.43`
*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Create HTML explanation of data update flow (v2.43)`

## Session End Notes:

Pushing documentation changes to GitHub. 

## Major Bug Fix: `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` Time Range Correction (The "Sticky Note" Saga)

**Problem:**
The `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` component, when calculating itself, was inadvertently using a merged time range derived from its parent's `datetime_array` to fetch its dependencies (specifically `proton.sun_dist_rsun`). This occurred if `plotbot` was called multiple times with different time ranges, causing `br_norm` to request `sun_dist_rsun` data for a period far exceeding the currently requested plot, leading to incorrect calculations or empty plots for the second `plotbot` call.

**Solution - "Passing the Sticky Note":**
The fix involved ensuring that the `original_requested_trange` from the `plotbot` call is explicitly passed down through the data loading and processing chain:

1.  **`get_data.py`**: Modified to pass the `trange` (the "sticky note") as `original_requested_trange` to `data_cubby.update_global_instance`.
2.  **`data_cubby.py`**:
    *   The `update_global_instance` method was updated to accept `original_requested_trange`.
    *   It now passes this `original_requested_trange` to the `update()` method of the specific data class instance (e.g., `mag_rtn_4sa_class`).
3.  **Data Classes (e.g., `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`, `psp_proton.py`):**
    *   Added `_current_operation_trange` attribute, initialized to `None`.
    *   The `update()` method in these classes now accepts `original_requested_trange` and stores it in `self._current_operation_trange`.
4.  **`psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` (`_calculate_br_norm` method):**
    *   This method now prioritizes `self._current_operation_trange` when determining the `trange_for_dependencies`.
    *   If `_current_operation_trange` is available, it uses this specific time range for its `get_data` call to fetch `proton.sun_dist_rsun`.
    *   A fallback to using `self.datetime_array` remains if `_current_operation_trange` is not set (though with the new flow, it should always be set during a standard `plotbot` call).

**Outcome:**
With these changes, `_calculate_br_norm` now requests its dependencies (like `sun_dist_rsun`) using the precise time range of the current `plotbot` call. This ensures that calculations are based on the correct data segment, resolving the issue of incorrect or missing `br_norm` data in subsequent `plotbot` calls with different time ranges. The test `test_two_call_incorrect_merged_trange` now passes, confirming the fix.

**Documentation:**
Created several HTML files to explain the problem and solution using the "Plotbot's Kitchen" metaphor:
*   `docs/br_norm_issue.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_trange_mystery.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_lost_sticky_note.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_sticky_note_success.html` (summarizing the successful fix)

**Other Minor Fixes During This Process:**
*   Corrected `global_tracker.update_data_range` to `global_tracker.update_calculated_range` in `get_data.py`.
*   Moved `mdates` and `interpolate` imports to be local within `_calculate_br_norm` in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`.

## Git Push Details (br_norm fix):

*   **Version:** `2025_05_19_v2.44`
*   **Commit Message:** `Fix: br_norm uses correct trange for dependencies via original_requested_trange. Docs: Added HTML explanations. Version: 2025_05_19_v2.44`
*   **Git Hash:** `bc02d5c`

## Bug Fix: `epad_strahl_class.update()` TypeError

**Problem:**
A `TypeError` occurred when calling `plotbot` with `epad.strahl`: `epad_strahl_class.update() got an unexpected keyword argument 'original_requested_trange'`.

**Cause:**
The `DataCubby.update_global_instance` method was modified to always pass `original_requested_trange` to the `update()` method of data class instances. While `mag_rtn_4sa_class` and `proton_class` were updated to accept this, `epad_strahl_class` and `epad_strahl_high_res_class` (in `plotbot/data_classes/psp_electron_classes.py`) had not been.

**Solution:**
Modified the `update()` methods in `epad_strahl_class` and `epad_strahl_high_res_class` to:
1.  Accept the `original_requested_trange: Optional[List[str]] = None` parameter.
2.  Initialize and store this parameter in `self._current_operation_trange` for consistency, even if not immediately used for further internal dependency fetching by these specific classes.

**Outcome:**
This resolved the `TypeError`, allowing `plotbot` calls involving `epad.strahl` (and likely `epad_hr.strahl`) to proceed correctly.

## Git Push Details (epad fix):

*   **Version:** `2025_05_19_v2.45`
*   **Commit Message:** `Fix: epad classes now accept original_requested_trange in update method. Version: 2025_05_19_v2.45`
*   **Git Hash:** `55fc89e`

## Investigation: Unexpected `br_norm` Calculation in `multiplot`

**Symptom:**
When using `multiplot` (e.g., with `mag_rtn_4sa.br` or other variables, not necessarily `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` itself), a `TypeError: len() of unsized object` would occur within `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` during the `_calculate_br_norm` method. This happened because `proton.sun_dist_rsun.data` was `None`.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The core issue was twofold, revealing a subtle interaction between lazy loading, state saving, and dependency data handling:

1.  **Unintended Triggering of `br_norm` Calculation:**
    *   The `mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()` method, called by `DataCubby` for each panel in `multiplot` to refresh data, contains a loop: `for subclass_name in self.raw_data.keys(): var = getattr(self, subclass_name) ...`.
    *   This loop iterates through all keys in `self.raw_data` (which includes `'br_norm'`) and calls `getattr(self, subclass_name)`.
    *   When `subclass_name` is `'br_norm'`, `getattr(self, 'br_norm')` accesses the `br_norm` property.
    *   Accessing the `br_norm` property, by design (lazy loading), triggers its `_calculate_br_norm()` method.
    *   This meant `_calculate_br_norm()` was being executed for each panel processed by `multiplot`, even if `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` was not the variable explicitly requested for plotting in that panel. The `update` method was trying to save the plot state of all its potential components, inadvertently waking up `br_norm`.

2.  **Failure to Load `proton.sun_dist_rsun` Dependency:**
    *   When `_calculate_br_norm()` (now unexpectedly triggered) called `get_data(panel_trange, proton.sun_dist_rsun)` to fetch its dependency, an issue arose if `proton` data for that `panel_trange` was deemed a "cache hit" by `global_tracker` (e.g., due to a previous panel loading overlapping data).
    *   In this cache-hit scenario, `get_data` would call `proton_instance.update(None, original_requested_trange=panel_trange)`.
    *   The `proton_class.update()` method, when receiving `imported_data=None`, would only update its internal `_current_operation_trange`. It would *not* re-fetch or re-process `self.raw_data['sun_dist_rsun']`.
    *   Consequently, `proton.sun_dist_rsun.data` remained `None` (or stale), leading to the `TypeError` when `_calculate_br_norm` tried to use its length.

**Status/Resolution Notes for this specific `TypeError`:**
*   The immediate `TypeError` (due to `proton.sun_dist_rsun.data` being `None`) was the primary focus of the `v2.44` fix, where the "sticky note" (`original_requested_trange`) was passed down. However, if `proton.sun_dist_rsun` itself isn't proactive in loading its data when its property is accessed (and `raw_data` is empty despite `_current_operation_trange` being set), this error could still manifest.
*   The fix in `v2.45` (making `epad_strahl_class` accept `original_requested_trange`) was unrelated to this specific `br_norm` calculation path but fixed a similar `TypeError` for `epad` plots.
*   The underlying issue of `mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()` unintentionally triggering `br_norm` calculation still needs to be addressed for true lazy loading behavior during updates if this behavior is not desired. A more targeted approach to state saving within `update()` would be required. 

## Major Debugging Insight: The "Stale Order Ticket" in Jupyter Notebooks

**Problem:**
We were observing a `TypeError: len() of unsized object` within `_calculate_br_norm` when trying to plot variables like `proton.anisotropy`. The mystery was why `mag_rtn_4sa.update()` (and thus `_calculate_br_norm`) was being called at all when the requested plot seemingly had nothing to do with `mag_rtn_4sa`.

**Root Cause Discovery (The "Stale Order Ticket"):**
The issue was traced back to the execution order within the `Examples_Multiplot.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook:
1.  The `plot_variable` was initially assigned to `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`.
2.  The `plot_data` list (used by `multiplot`) was constructed using this initial `plot_variable`. Thus, `plot_data` contained references to `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` instances.
3.  Later, `plot_variable` was reassigned to `proton.anisotropy` (or another variable).
4.  However, `multiplot` was called with the *original* `plot_data` list, which still held the "stale order" for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`.

This meant `multiplot` was indeed (correctly, based on the stale `plot_data`) attempting to process `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` for each panel, leading to the `mag_rtn_4sa.update()` call and the subsequent error chain when `_calculate_br_norm` couldn't get its `proton.sun_dist_rsun` dependency (due to the previously discussed cache-hit/update logic in `proton_class`).

**Resolution/Clarification:**
By ensuring the `plot_data` list is constructed *after* `plot_variable` is set to the desired variable for the current plotting session, the correct variable instances are passed to `multiplot`. This resolved the unexpected `TypeError` when plotting `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` (and by extension, likely resolved any similar errors if `proton.anisotropy` was intended but `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` was accidentally passed via a stale `plot_data`).

**Documentation:**
*   Created `docs/br_norm_uninvited_guest_mystery.html` to explain why `_calculate_br_norm` was being triggered by `mag_rtn_4sa_class.update()`'s internal loop.
*   Created `docs/notebook_stale_plot_data_mystery.html` to specifically address the Jupyter Notebook execution order issue and the "stale order ticket" problem.

**Next Steps (From User):**
1.  Re-verify plotting `proton.anisotropy` to ensure the notebook execution order fix has resolved any issues there.
2.  Investigate why Carrington longitude plots might be using a date for the x-axis and displaying data in "weird spread out chunks."

## Git Push Details (End of Session - Notebook Issue Fix & Docs):

*   **Version:** `2025_05_19_v2.46`
*   **Commit Message:** `v2.46: Docs: Explain br_norm TypeError & notebook execution flow. Fix stale plot_data in example.`
*   **Key Changes:** Added HTML documentation explaining the `br_norm` TypeError (uninvited guest due to `mag_rtn_4sa.update()` loop) and the Jupyter notebook execution order issue (stale `plot_data` list). The notebook example was implicitly fixed by understanding this, leading to successful `br_norm` plotting when intended.
