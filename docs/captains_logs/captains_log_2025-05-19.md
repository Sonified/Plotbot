# Captain's Log - 2025-05-19

## Session Start

**Goal:** Assist Robert with understanding the data update flow in Plotbot and document it.

## Key Activities & Learnings:

1.  **Data Update Flow Documentation:**
    *   Robert requested a more user-friendly explanation of Plotbot's data update mechanism, particularly focusing on the roles of `get_data`, `global_tracker`, `DataCubby`, and how calculated properties are handled.
    *   Used the metaphor of "Plotbot's Kitchen" with a Chef, ingredients, pantry, prep cooks, and a quartermaster (DataCubby) to make the explanation more approachable.
    *   Initially planned to create a Markdown file, but per Robert's preference, directly generated an HTML file: `docs/data_update_flow_explained.html`.
    *   This HTML file includes basic styling to improve readability.

## Git Push Details:

*   **Version:** `2025_05_18_v2.43`
*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Create HTML explanation of data update flow (v2.43)`

## Session End Notes:

Pushing documentation changes to GitHub.
