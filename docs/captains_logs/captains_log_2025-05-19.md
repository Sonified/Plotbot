# Captain's Log - 2025-05-19

## Session Start

**Goal:** Assist Robert with understanding the data update flow in Plotbot and document it.

## Key Activities & Learnings:

1.  **Data Update Flow Documentation:**
    *   Robert requested a more user-friendly explanation of Plotbot's data update mechanism, particularly focusing on the roles of `get_data`, `global_tracker`, `DataCubby`, and how calculated properties are handled.
    *   Used the metaphor of "Plotbot's Kitchen" with a Chef, ingredients, pantry, prep cooks, and a quartermaster (DataCubby) to make the explanation more approachable.
    *   Initially planned to create a Markdown file, but per Robert's preference, directly generated an HTML file: `docs/data_update_flow_explained.html`.
    *   This HTML file includes basic styling to improve readability.

## Git Push Details:

*   **Version:** `2025_05_18_v2.43`
*   **Commit Message:** `docs: Create HTML explanation of data update flow (v2.43)`

## Session End Notes:

Pushing documentation changes to GitHub. 

## Major Bug Fix: `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` Time Range Correction (The "Sticky Note" Saga)

**Problem:**
The `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` component, when calculating itself, was inadvertently using a merged time range derived from its parent's `datetime_array` to fetch its dependencies (specifically `proton.sun_dist_rsun`). This occurred if `plotbot` was called multiple times with different time ranges, causing `br_norm` to request `sun_dist_rsun` data for a period far exceeding the currently requested plot, leading to incorrect calculations or empty plots for the second `plotbot` call.

**Solution - "Passing the Sticky Note":**
The fix involved ensuring that the `original_requested_trange` from the `plotbot` call is explicitly passed down through the data loading and processing chain:

1.  **`get_data.py`**: Modified to pass the `trange` (the "sticky note") as `original_requested_trange` to `data_cubby.update_global_instance`.
2.  **`data_cubby.py`**:
    *   The `update_global_instance` method was updated to accept `original_requested_trange`.
    *   It now passes this `original_requested_trange` to the `update()` method of the specific data class instance (e.g., `mag_rtn_4sa_class`).
3.  **Data Classes (e.g., `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`, `psp_proton.py`):**
    *   Added `_current_operation_trange` attribute, initialized to `None`.
    *   The `update()` method in these classes now accepts `original_requested_trange` and stores it in `self._current_operation_trange`.
4.  **`psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` (`_calculate_br_norm` method):**
    *   This method now prioritizes `self._current_operation_trange` when determining the `trange_for_dependencies`.
    *   If `_current_operation_trange` is available, it uses this specific time range for its `get_data` call to fetch `proton.sun_dist_rsun`.
    *   A fallback to using `self.datetime_array` remains if `_current_operation_trange` is not set (though with the new flow, it should always be set during a standard `plotbot` call).

**Outcome:**
With these changes, `_calculate_br_norm` now requests its dependencies (like `sun_dist_rsun`) using the precise time range of the current `plotbot` call. This ensures that calculations are based on the correct data segment, resolving the issue of incorrect or missing `br_norm` data in subsequent `plotbot` calls with different time ranges. The test `test_two_call_incorrect_merged_trange` now passes, confirming the fix.

**Documentation:**
Created several HTML files to explain the problem and solution using the "Plotbot's Kitchen" metaphor:
*   `docs/br_norm_issue.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_trange_mystery.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_lost_sticky_note.html`
*   `docs/br_norm_sticky_note_success.html` (summarizing the successful fix)

**Other Minor Fixes During This Process:**
*   Corrected `global_tracker.update_data_range` to `global_tracker.update_calculated_range` in `get_data.py`.
*   Moved `mdates` and `interpolate` imports to be local within `_calculate_br_norm` in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`.

## Git Push Details (br_norm fix):

*   **Version:** `2025_05_19_v2.44`
*   **Commit Message:** `Fix: br_norm uses correct trange for dependencies via original_requested_trange. Docs: Added HTML explanations. Version: 2025_05_19_v2.44`
*   **Git Hash:** `bc02d5c`

## Bug Fix: `epad_strahl_class.update()` TypeError

**Problem:**
A `TypeError` occurred when calling `plotbot` with `epad.strahl`: `epad_strahl_class.update() got an unexpected keyword argument 'original_requested_trange'`.

**Cause:**
The `DataCubby.update_global_instance` method was modified to always pass `original_requested_trange` to the `update()` method of data class instances. While `mag_rtn_4sa_class` and `proton_class` were updated to accept this, `epad_strahl_class` and `epad_strahl_high_res_class` (in `plotbot/data_classes/psp_electron_classes.py`) had not been.

**Solution:**
Modified the `update()` methods in `epad_strahl_class` and `epad_strahl_high_res_class` to:
1.  Accept the `original_requested_trange: Optional[List[str]] = None` parameter.
2.  Initialize and store this parameter in `self._current_operation_trange` for consistency, even if not immediately used for further internal dependency fetching by these specific classes.

**Outcome:**
This resolved the `TypeError`, allowing `plotbot` calls involving `epad.strahl` (and likely `epad_hr.strahl`) to proceed correctly.

## Git Push Details (epad fix):

*   **Version:** `2025_05_19_v2.45`
*   **Commit Message:** `Fix: epad classes now accept original_requested_trange in update method. Version: 2025_05_19_v2.45`
*   **Git Hash:** `(to be filled after push)`
