## üéâ Major Victory: Pyspedas Lazy Loading Implementation Complete

### **Problem Solved**: SPEDAS_DATA_DIR Control
**Issue**: Users could not reliably set custom data directories for pyspedas downloads because pyspedas was being imported eagerly during plotbot initialization, which cached configuration before users could set environment variables.

**Root Cause**: Two files had eager pyspedas imports at module level:
- `plotbot/vdyes.py` line 15: `import pyspedas`
- `plotbot/plotbot_interactive_vdf.py` line 92: `import pyspedas`

### **Solution Implemented**: True Lazy Loading
1. **Fixed eager imports**: Moved pyspedas imports inside functions where they're actually used
2. **Enhanced config system**: `config.data_dir` setter now automatically updates `SPEDAS_DATA_DIR` environment variable
3. **Removed unnecessary init logic**: Cleaned up plotbot `__init__.py` to not set environment variables at import time

### **User Experience Now**:
```python
from plotbot import *  # Fast import, no pyspedas loaded

# Set data directory ANYTIME (even after import)
config.data_dir = '/my/custom/data/path'  
# ‚úÖ Automatically sets SPEDAS_DATA_DIR
# ‚úÖ Creates directory if needed
# ‚úÖ Provides user feedback

# pyspedas loads lazily when VDF functions are called
vdyes(['2020/01/29 18:00:00', '2020/01/29 19:00:00'])
```

### **Test Suite Created**: 
Created comprehensive test script `tests/test_pyspedas_lazy_loading.py` that verifies:
- ‚úÖ plotbot imports without loading pyspedas (1.68s import time)
- ‚úÖ SPEDAS_DATA_DIR can be set after import
- ‚úÖ pyspedas loads only when VDF functions are called
- ‚úÖ Both `vdyes()` and `plotbot_interactive_vdf()` use lazy loading

**All tests pass**: 4/4 successful lazy loading verification.

### **Additional Fixes**:
- Fixed missing `FallbackPrintManager` in `magnetic_hole_finder/data_management.py`
- Removed eager pyspedas imports from magnetic hole finder module
- Enhanced config system with better user feedback

### **Critical Learning**: 
**ALWAYS RESTART JUPYTER KERNELS** after making changes to imported Python modules! The initial test failures were due to cached imports in the kernel, not actual code issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Multiplot Spectral Colorbar Broken

**Problem**: The colorbar for spectral plots in multiplot is currently broken after recent changes.

**Impact**: Affects spectral data visualization in multi-panel plots.

**Status**: Identified but not yet investigated. Requires investigation and fix.

**Priority**: Medium - affects visualization quality but doesn't break core functionality.

## üìà Overall Impact

**Major Win**: Plotbot now has true lazy loading, making it:
- **Faster** to import (no heavy dependencies loaded upfront)
- **More controllable** (users can set data directories reliably) 
- **More predictable** (pyspedas loads only when needed)

This resolves a long-standing user experience issue and makes plotbot much more pleasant to work with in notebooks and scripts.
