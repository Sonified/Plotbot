## Updates & Progress

- **Plotbot Optimization:** Successfully refactored `plotbot_main.py` by removing the entirety of "Phase 2 (Load Standard Data)". This phase was identified as redundant because the consolidated data loading logic in the subsequent phase (now the primary data handling block) correctly manages data acquisition for all necessary variables, including checks against `global_tracker` to avoid reloading cached data.
  - This change simplifies the data loading pipeline within Plotbot.
  - The attempted optimization to conditionally create `times_mesh` in `psp_proton.py` did not yield the expected significant performance improvements for cached data and was reverted.

- **Proton Spectral Data Handling Fix:** Successfully debugged an issue where `psp_proton.py` failed to correctly merge data for adjacent time ranges due to an `AttributeError` during `times_mesh` creation.
    - The `calculate_variables` method was trying to access `self.raw_data['energy_flux']` (and similar for theta/phi) before `self.raw_data` was fully updated with the spectral data arrays for the current calculation.
    - Corrected the logic to directly use `self.energy_flux.shape[1]` (and `self.theta_flux.shape[1]`) for `np.arange` when creating `self.times_mesh` and `self.times_mesh_angle`, as `self.energy_flux` (etc.) are assigned the numpy arrays earlier in the method.
    - Removed redundant local variable assignments for `eflux_v_energy`, `eflux_v_theta`, and `eflux_v_phi` in `psp_proton.py`'s `calculate_variables`.
    - The test `test_proton_energy_flux_adjacent_trange_issue_observational` now passes, confirming correct data merging.
