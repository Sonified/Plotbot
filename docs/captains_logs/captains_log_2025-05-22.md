## Updates & Progress

- **Plotbot Optimization:** Successfully refactored `plotbot_main.py` by removing the entirety of "Phase 2 (Load Standard Data)". This phase was identified as redundant because the consolidated data loading logic in the subsequent phase (now the primary data handling block) correctly manages data acquisition for all necessary variables, including checks against `global_tracker` to avoid reloading cached data.
  - This change simplifies the data loading pipeline within Plotbot.
  - The attempted optimization to conditionally create `times_mesh` in `psp_proton.py` did not yield the expected significant performance improvements for cached data and was reverted.

## Versioning

- **New Version:** `2025_05_22_v2.50`
- **Commit Message:** `v2.50 Refactor: Removed redundant Phase 2 data loading from Plotbot for optimization.`
