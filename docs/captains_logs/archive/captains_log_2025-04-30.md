# Captain's Log - April 30, 2025

## Activities & Learnings 

-   **Proton FITS Naming Convention & Type Hints:** Aligned naming conventions for several `proton_fits_class` attributes where the attribute name included a `_pfits` suffix (e.g., `vdrift_va_pfits`, `valfven_pfits`, `vsw_mach_pfits`, `beta_ppar_pfits`, `beta_pperp_pfits`) while the internal `var_name` did not. Updated the `psp_proton_fits_classes.pyi` stub file to match the actual attribute names used in `psp_proton_fits_classes.py`. This ensures correct type hinting for these attributes. Also adjusted the attribute name for absolute heat flux to `abs_qz_p` in both the `.py` and `.pyi` files for consistency and user preference. 

-   **Multiplot Global Y-Limit Fix & Testing:** Refactored `MultiplotOptions` in `multiplot_options.py` and `multiplot_options.pyi` to correctly handle setting a global y-limit using `plt.options.set_global_y_limit()`. The previous implementation failed because it only applied limits to axes existing at the time of the call, not axes created dynamically during the `multiplot` run. The fix involves storing the global limit and applying it within `_get_axis_options` when a new `AxisOptions` instance is created. Ran all tests in `test_multiplot.py` and `test_stardust.py` successfully, confirming the fix didn't introduce regressions.

-   **Longitude X-Axis Preparation & Test Cleanup:** Made several preparatory changes to support plotting against Carrington Longitude in `multiplot`. This included:
    -   Adding the Parker Solar Probe Carrington Longitude data file (`Parker-CARR-LON.npz`) to `support_data/trajectories/`.
    -   Updating `utils.py` (details pending, but modifications made as part of this effort).
    -   Creating `pytest.ini` to filter specific Matplotlib `UserWarnings` during tests, improving output clarity for future testing including this feature.
