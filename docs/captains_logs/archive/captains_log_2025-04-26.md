# Captain's Log - April 26, 2025

## Activities & Learnings

- Basic plot tests in `tests/test_all_plot_basics.py` passed successfully.
- Staging and pushing numerous untracked/modified files that were missed in a previous commit.
  - Commit message: "chore: Add untracked files and update tests" 
- Reverted `Plotbot.ipynb` to the version from two commits prior (`origin/main~1`) to restore the correct content after an accidental overwrite.
  - Pushing this correct version with commit message: "fix: Revert Plotbot.ipynb to previous working version" 
- Fixed Pyspedas verbosity issue where INFO logs appeared even when `print_manager.pyspedas_verbose` was `False`. Corrected logic in `print_manager._configure_pyspedas_logging` to always apply/remove the filter based on the flag, regardless of `config.data_server`. Cleaned up diagnostic prints.
- Cleaned up main `Plotbot.ipynb` and created two new example notebooks: `Plotbot_Examples_Multiplot.ipynb` and `Plotbot_Examples_Custom_Variables.ipynb`.

--- Pushing Changes ---
- **Version Tag:** `2025_04_26_v1.11`
- **Commit Message:** `fix: Correct Pyspedas verbosity & cleanup notebooks`
  
- **Learning:** When performing significant Git operations that alter the working directory (like `reset --hard`, `checkout`, `merge`, `stash apply`), it's crucial to reload the editor window afterwards to ensure its internal cache syncs with the actual file state on disk. This prevents stale cached versions from causing unexpected reversions or conflicts.
