## Feature Development: Testing Br Normalization Calculation

- **Summary:** Developed comprehensive tests for calculating the normalized radial magnetic field (Br*R²). This critical solar physics parameter accounts for the 1/r² decrease of the magnetic field strength with distance from the Sun, allowing for meaningful comparisons between measurements at different solar distances.

- **Test Implementation Details:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_calculation.py` with multiple test cases:
        - Short timerange test (6-hour window)
        - Long timerange test (24-hour window)
        - Extended timerange test (6-day window)
        - Comparison between magnetometer types (mag_rtn_4sa vs mag_rtn)
    - Validated the formula: `Br_norm = Br * ((Rsun / 215.032867644)²)`
    - Confirmed the formula works with both high-resolution (4sa) and standard magnetometer data
    - Implemented a solar radius to AU conversion factor with appropriate precision (215.032867644)
    - Validated interpolation function for mapping Sun distance data to magnetometer timeline when data have different cadences

- **Implementation Testing Strategy:**
    - Created `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py` to test key implementation patterns:
        - Lazy loading: Ensuring br_norm is only calculated when specifically requested
        - Dependency resolution: Testing cross-class dependency between mag and proton classes
        - Error handling: Graceful degradation when proton data isn't available
        - Calculation reuse: Verified that calculated values are properly cached and reused

- **Implementation Plan:**
    - Add `br_norm` calculation to `mag_rtn_4sa` and `mag_rtn` classes
    - Use lazy loading through `__getattr__` to trigger calculation only when requested
    - Ensure proper plotting options for visualizing the normalized field
    - Handle error cases when proton data isn't available
    - Document the approach in code comments for future maintenance

- **Scientific Insights:**
    - The normalized values typically range from -3 to +3 nT·AU²
    - This isn't a statistical normalization, but a physical correction accounting for radial distance effects
    - Sign changes (negative to positive) properly represent field polarity changes

## Development Status Investigation

- **Codebase Analysis:**
    - Found `test_psp_mag_br_norm.py` which expects br_norm to exist and work
    - However, the `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` file doesn't currently implement br_norm
    - The class' `__getattr__` method has a quirk: it prints a friendly error message but doesn't raise an AttributeError
    - This causes `hasattr(mag_rtn_4sa, 'br_norm')` to return True even though br_norm isn't implemented
    - Confirmed the `proton` class already has the `sun_dist_rsun` data we need for the br_norm calculation:
        - The value is properly initialized in the proton raw_data dictionary
        - It's calculated from SUN_DIST data during calculate_variables()
        - A plot_manager is created with appropriate plotting options

- **Additional Insights:**
    - The `proton` class converts spacecraft distance directly from kilometers to solar radii (dividing by 695700.0)
    - This conversion happens at data loading time, not at calculation time
    - While unusual to not store the raw value, this was an intentional design choice per the comment "Added from Jaye's version"
    - The friendly error handling in `__getattr__` improves user experience but creates unexpected behavior for testing
    - Our test approach is split between:
        - `test_br_norm_calculation.py`: Uses REAL data through the full processing chain
        - `test_br_norm_lazy_loading.py`: Uses mocks to verify the class behavior patterns would work correctly

- **Detailed Implementation Plan:**
    1. **Update mag_rtn_4sa Class:**
       - Add `'br_norm': None` to raw_data initialization in __init__
       - Extend __getattr__ to handle special case for br_norm, triggering calculation when requested
       - Implement _calculate_br_norm method to:
         - Check if br data exists
         - Get proton sun_dist_rsun data if not already loaded
         - Interpolate sun distance to match mag timeline
         - Calculate br_norm using the validated formula
         - Store result in raw_data['br_norm']

    2. **Add Plot Options:**
       - Add plot_manager for br_norm in set_ploptions method
       - Use appropriate visualization parameters:
         - Y-label: 'Br·R² [nT·AU²]'
         - Legend: '$B_R \cdot R^2$'
         - Color: Different from br (e.g., 'darkorange')
         - Scale: 'linear'

    3. **Error Handling:**
       - Add robust error checking in _calculate_br_norm
       - Handle cases when proton data isn't available
       - Return NaN array for br_norm when calculation isn't possible
       - Add clear debug messaging

    4. **Documentation:**
       - Add docstrings explaining the physical significance of br_norm
       - Document dependencies on proton.sun_dist_rsun
       - Add formulas and conversion factors in comments

## Implementation Progress and Issues

- **Circular Import Fix:**
   - Identified circular import issue between data_cubby.py and psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py
   - Fixed by removing the global import of get_data in psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py and keeping it in the _calculate_br_norm method
   - This allows the tests to run without import errors

- **Data Loading Issue & `br_norm` Access:**
   - An earlier identified issue where `proton.datetime_array` could be `None` while `proton.sun_dist_rsun.data` was available (indicating a partially loaded state for the proton class) may still be relevant but is secondary to the immediate `br_norm` access problem.
   - **Refined Understanding of `__getattr__` and Testing for `br_norm`:**
     - The core issue remains the contradictory behavior observed: the `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`'s `__getattr__` method prints the "not a recognized attribute" message (while still listing `br_norm` as an option) but doesn't raise an `AttributeError`. At commit `6125f87`, this leads to `hasattr(mag_rtn_4sa, 'br_norm')` returning `True` misleadingly.
     - **Implication for Testing:** This non-raising behavior meant initial tests (like the original `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke`) could pass by merely checking for plot creation, as the underlying `br_norm` data might be missing or inaccessible without the test failing.
     - **Revised Test Strategy Implemented:**
       1.  A new test, `test_plotbot_br_data_verification`, was created. It successfully verified that `mag_rtn_4sa.br.data` correctly returns a populated numpy array when requested via `plotbot`. This test established a reliable method for checking actual data presence (verifying `.data` attribute, its `np.ndarray` type, and `len > 0`).
       2.  The existing `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` (in `tests/test_psp_mag_br_norm.py`) was then modified to incorporate these same rigorous data verification checks specifically for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`.
     - **Current Status & Next Step:** The enhanced `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` correctly fails, confirming `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` is `None`. The tagged print output confirms the "not a recognized attribute" messages for `br_norm` originate from `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`'s `__getattr__`.
       The critical question now is: why does accessing `mag_rtn_4sa.br` succeed (as proven by `test_plotbot_br_data_verification`), while `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` fails, even though both are keys in `self.raw_data` and should be handled by `__getattr__` if not found as direct attributes?
       Our immediate task is to trace the execution path for `br` versus `br_norm` within `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`. We need to identify where `br` (and other standard components like `bt`, `bn`, `bmag`) are successfully instantiated as `plot_manager` objects and made available as attributes, and why this process is failing or being bypassed for `br_norm`. Understanding this discrepancy is key before modifying `__getattr__` to raise `AttributeError`, as the root cause might be in the setup/calculation logic for `br_norm` itself, or how `__getattr__` attempts to retrieve/create it.

## Push: v2.39

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_18_v2.39`
- **Commit Message:** `Feature: Document implementation plan for br_norm calculation (v2.39)`
- **Git Hash:** `b3198d0`
- **Summary:** Added detailed analysis of the codebase structure and a comprehensive implementation plan for the br_norm calculation feature. Discovered key insights about the proton class's sun distance data handling and the magnetometer class's attribute resolution behavior that will inform our implementation approach.

## Push: v2.40

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_18_v2.40`
- **Commit Message:** `Fix: Circular import in br_norm implementation & identify data loading issue (v2.40)`
- **Git Hash:** `2a1b355`
- **Summary:** Fixed the circular import issue by removing the global import of get_data from psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py and keeping it inside the _calculate_br_norm method. While testing the fix, identified a new issue where proton.datetime_array is None while sun_dist_rsun.data is available, indicating a partially loaded state that needs to be addressed in future work.

## Learning: Plotbot Error Handling and Test Implications

- **Observation:** A key characteristic of Plotbot's design is its tendency to avoid outright crashes. Instead of crashing, it may print "friendly" error messages (like "'attribute' is not a recognized attribute, friend!") and continue execution. In the context of `__getattr__`, if an `AttributeError` is not explicitly raised, `hasattr()` can return `True` even if the attribute isn't properly accessible or doesn't contain valid data.
- **Implication for Testing:** This behavior means that tests, especially "smoke tests" that primarily check if a plot can be generated, might pass superficially. The plot might be created, but it could be empty or contain incorrect data because the underlying data retrieval or calculation failed without halting the test.
- **Revised Test Strategy:** Future tests, particularly for data-dependent attributes like `br_norm`, must go beyond checking for the absence of crashes. They need to explicitly verify that the `.data` component of a plot_manager object is not None, has the expected shape/length, and ideally, sample some values to ensure data integrity. Tests should assert that data is present and valid, not just that an attribute exists or a plot function can be called.

## Test Strategy Refinement for `br_norm`

- **Problem Identification:** Previous runs of `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` in `tests/test_psp_mag_br_norm.py` were passing. However, this was misleading because the test only checked if a plot figure was created, not if `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` actually contained valid data. The console output still showed the "br_norm is not a recognized attribute, friend!" message from `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`'s `__getattr__` method, indicating an underlying issue with accessing `br_norm`.
- **Verification Test for `.br`:** To establish a reliable method for data verification, a new test, `test_plotbot_br_data_verification`, was added to `tests/test_psp_mag_br_norm.py`. This test successfully confirmed that `mag_rtn_4sa.br.data` returns a populated numpy array when requested via `plotbot`. It checks `hasattr`, `.data` presence, `isinstance(np.ndarray)`, and `len > 0`.
- **Enhancing `br_norm` Smoke Test:** The `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` was then updated to incorporate these same data verification checks for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`. This aims to ensure the test only passes if `br_norm` not only allows a plot to be made but also provides actual, non-empty data.
- **Next Step:** The immediate next step is to run the modified `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke`. We anticipate this test will now fail at the data verification stage, pinpointing that `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` is not being correctly populated or made accessible, despite the `__getattr__` method in `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py` not raising an `AttributeError` (as per commit `6125f87`) which previously led to `hasattr` returning `True` misleadingly. This will guide our debugging of the `br_norm` calculation and access mechanism.

## Summary of Changes Before Push (v2.41)

- **`br_norm` Testing Enhancements:**
  - Updated `docs/captains_logs/captains_log_2025-05-18.md` with a more detailed analysis of `psp_mag_rtn_4sa.py`'s `__getattr__` behavior, its implications for `br_norm` testing, and the refined testing strategy.
  - Added a new test, `test_plotbot_br_data_verification`, to `tests/test_psp_mag_br_norm.py` to establish a reliable method for verifying actual data return from plotbot calls, confirming successful data retrieval for `mag_rtn_4sa.br`.
  - Modified the existing `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` in `tests/test_psp_mag_br_norm.py` to incorporate these rigorous data verification checks (checking for `.data` attribute, numpy array type, and non-empty content) for `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm`.
  - Confirmed via test execution that `test_plotbot_br_norm_smoke` now fails as expected, pinpointing that `mag_rtn_4sa.br_norm` is `None`, guiding future debugging efforts for `br_norm` accessibility.
