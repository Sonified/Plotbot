# Captain's Log - April 29, 2025

## Activities & Learnings
 
- Resolved a file state conflict where `plotbot/data_import.py` was incorrectly showing old, uncommitted changes after a `git reset --hard`. 
  - **Diagnosis:** This was caused by VS Code's in-memory cache holding onto a previous version of the file and overriding the correct version restored by Git.
  - **Fix:** Reloaded the VS Code window (Cmd+Shift+P -> "Reload Window") to clear the editor's file cache, then ran `git checkout HEAD -- plotbot/data_import.py` to ensure the file matched the repository's state.
  - **Key Learning:** It is crucial to reload the editor window after *any* significant Git operation that modifies the working directory (e.g., `git pull`, `git checkout`, `git reset --hard`, `git merge`, `git stash apply`). This ensures the editor reads the fresh state from disk and prevents its internal cache from causing unexpected conflicts or overwriting correct file versions.

- **Test Suite Execution & Fixes:**
  - Ran all major test suites (`test_ham_freshness`, `test_multiplot`, `test_plotbot`, `test_custom_variables`, `test_pyspedas_download`, `test_fits_integration`, `test_core_functionality`, `test_all_plot_basics`).
  - Fixed `DeprecationWarning` in `plotbot/data_import.py` related to timezone-aware datetime conversion.
  - Fixed `TypeError` in `plotbot/multiplot.py` by replacing incorrect `download_berkeley_data` call with `get_data`.
  - Skipped `test_offline_download_behavior` in `tests/test_pyspedas_download.py` as it requires manual intervention.
  - Resolved `PytestCollectionWarning` in `tests/test_fits_integration.py` by renaming `TestDataObject` namedtuple to `FitsTestDataContainer`.
  - **Result:** All run tests now pass, except for the known failures in `test_plotbot.py` which need further investigation.

- **`.pyi` File Correction:**
  - Discovered that several `.pyi` stub files (`plotbot/data_classes/psp_mag_classes.pyi`, `psp_electron_classes.pyi`, `psp_proton_classes.pyi`, `psp_proton_fits_classes.pyi`, `psp_ham_classes.pyi`, and `plotbot/print_manager.pyi`) incorrectly contained full implementation code instead of stub definitions (`...`).
  - This likely occurred due to an unknown previous operation or tooling error.
  - Encountered significant difficulty correcting these files using automated edits, likely due to persistent VS Code caching issues (similar to the `plotbot/data_import.py` incident) preventing the tool from seeing the correct file state or applying overwrite edits reliably.
  - **Fix:** Manually replaced the content of each affected `.pyi` file with the correct stub definitions generated from their corresponding `.py` implementation files.
  - **Key Learning:** Stub files (`.pyi`) must *only* contain signatures and `...` for implementation bodies. Editor/filesystem caching can severely interfere with automated file operations, sometimes requiring manual intervention and editor reloads.

**Push to GitHub:**
- **Version Tag:** `v1.12`
- **Commit Message:** `fix: Pass tests, correct .pyi stubs, untrack ignored files (v1.12)`
- **Summary:** Addressed several test failures (`DeprecationWarning`, `TypeError`, `PytestCollectionWarning`), manually corrected `.pyi` files that contained implementation code instead of stubs, and removed previously tracked files/directories (`.vscode/`, `ace_data/.../2018/`) that are now ignored.

**Update (April 30, 2025):**

- **Alpha FITS Integration:**
  - Implemented the `alpha_fits_class` in `plotbot/data_classes/psp_alpha_fits_classes.py` to handle data derived from SF01 (alpha particle) FITS CSV files.
  - This includes internal calculations for derived alpha parameters (e.g., `va_mag`, `Tp_alpha`, `beta_alpha`) based on SF01 inputs and aligned proton data dependencies (fetched from the `proton_fits` instance via `data_cubby`).
  - Configured `set_ploptions` within the class to create `plot_manager` instances for the 17 target plottable alpha variables.

- **FITS Test Suite Splitting:**
  - Separated the FITS integration tests into two distinct files:
    - `tests/test_sf00_proton_fits_integration.py`: Focuses solely on testing the proton FITS (`proton_fits_class`) functionality.
    - `tests/test_sf01_alpha_fits_integration.py`: Focuses solely on testing the *new* alpha FITS (`alpha_fits_class`) functionality.
  - This separation provides clearer testing boundaries for each particle species.

- **Stardust Test Refinement (`tests/test_stardust.py`):**
  - Established `tests/test_stardust.py` as the primary catch-all test suite for verifying core Plotbot functionality across different modules (basic plotting, multiplot, showdahodo, HAM data, FITS data, custom variables, audification).
  - Modified the FITS test within `test_stardust.py` (`test_stardust_fits_group_1`) to:
    - Use a known-good data source date (`20240930`) shared with `test_sf00_proton_fits_integration.py`.
    - Use the correct corresponding time range.
    - Use the correct variable names (`qz_p`, `vsw_mach_pfits`, etc.) as defined in `test_sf00_proton_fits_integration.py`.
  - This ensures the stardust FITS test now *runs and passes*, providing a real check of proton FITS integration within the stardust suite, rather than skipping due to missing data for its original test date.
  - All 11 tests within `test_stardust.py` now pass.

- **Test Success:** Confirmed that all tests in `tests/test_stardust.py` and `tests/test_sf00_proton_fits_integration.py` pass successfully after recent changes and fixes. 
- **Next Steps (Alpha FITS):** While the `alpha_fits_class` structure and basic calculations are in place, the next step is to fully integrate alpha FITS data into the plotting functions (`plotbot`, `multiplot`, `showdahodo`), thoroughly validate the calculations against expected results, and ensure the `tests/test_sf01_alpha_fits_integration.py` suite provides comprehensive coverage.

- **SPDF Download Tests:** Added a specific SPDF download test (`test_pyspedas_download_with_cleanup`) to `tests/test_pyspedas_download.py`. Also modified this test and the similar one in `tests/test_stardust.py` (`test_stardust_spdf_download_with_cleanup`) to *not* delete the downloaded CDF file after the test runs. This allows the file to remain cached locally for subsequent test runs or manual inspection.
