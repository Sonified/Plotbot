## Activities & Learnings

### Debugging `test_save_multi_day_creates_daily_pkls` Failure

- **Initial Problem:** The test `test_save_multi_day_creates_daily_pkls` consistently failed with `AssertionError: data_cubby_index.json was not created`.
- **Debugging Steps & Findings:**
    - Added `np.copy()` when slicing data in `data_cubby.save_to_disk` to prevent NumPy view issues potentially causing large PKL files and silent errors. This did not resolve the index file assertion.
    - Corrected path generation in `data_cubby._get_storage_path_for_object` to include the year subdirectory based on data timestamps, aligning with `psp_data_types.py`. This also did not resolve the index file assertion.
    - Added debug prints throughout `data_cubby.save_to_disk`, revealing the function was exiting before the final index file write step, likely due to an error within the main processing loop.
    - Further prints indicated the processing loop wasn't even being entered for the relevant data type (`mag_RTN_4sa`).
    - Added prints around the `target_instance.update()` call in `get_data.py`, which also didn't appear, indicating the `if needs_import or needs_refresh:` condition was failing.
    - Added a print before the `if needs_import or needs_refresh:` condition, which showed the `required_data_types` set was empty (`set()`).
    - **Root Cause Identified:** The initial variable identification loop in `get_data.py` was failing to process the class instance (`pb.mag_rtn_4sa`) passed by the test. It incorrectly tried accessing `.class_name` and `.data_type` on the instance, triggering `__getattr__` in `psp_mag_classes.py` (printing the helper messages) but ultimately failing to add `'mag_RTN_4sa'` to `required_data_types`.
    - **Correction Attempt 1:** Modified `get_data.py`'s initial loop to use `isinstance()` checks. Initially used instance names (e.g., `isinstance(var, mag_rtn_4sa)`) resulting in `TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type...`.
    - **Correction Attempt 2:** Corrected `isinstance()` checks to use class names (e.g., `isinstance(var, mag_rtn_4sa_class)`). This led to `NameError: name 'mag_rtn_4sa_class' is not defined` because the class types were not explicitly imported into `get_data.py`.
- **Next Step:** Explicitly import the required class definitions *and instances* into `get_data.py` to resolve the `NameError`.

## Test Run Results (April 29, 2025)

- **Action:** Corrected imports in `plotbot/get_data.py` to include both class types (for `isinstance`) and global instances (for `data_type_to_instance_map`). Reran tests in `test_data_cubby_daily_pkl.py` and `test_data_cubby_pkl_saving.py`.
- **Outcome:** 6 tests passed, 7 tests failed, 1 warning.
- **Passed Tests:**
    - `test_load_specific_mag_rtn_hourly_pkl`
    - `test_inspect_saved_daily_pkl_content` 
    - (Implied passes for other tests in `test_data_cubby_pkl_saving.py` that setup/verify basic `save_to_disk` functionality without relying on `plotbot` or complex loading: `test_save_to_disk_daily_regex_match`, `test_save_to_disk_dict_structure`, `test_save_to_disk_uses_copy`, `test_save_to_disk_with_existing_index`)
- **Failed Tests & Errors:**
    - `test_save_multi_day_creates_daily_pkls`: `AssertionError: Expected daily PKL file for Day 1 (...) was not found.`
    - `test_pkl_saving_on_plotbot_call`: `AssertionError: Expected PKL file pattern (...) was not found.`
    - `test_pkl_integrity_and_cache_load`: `AssertionError: Failed to load data back from disk...` (This likely failed because the PKL wasn't created in the first place).
    - `test_pkl_file_location_persistence`: `AssertionError: Expected PKL file pattern (...) was not found.`
    - `test_pkl_saving_full_day`: `AssertionError: Expected PKL file pattern (...) was not found.`
    - `test_pkl_saving_mag_rtn_hourly`: `AssertionError: data_cubby_index.json was not created...`
    - `test_save_to_disk_hourly_regex_match`: `Failed: copy.deepcopy was not called...` (Suggests the code path needing deepcopy wasn't reached in the mock).
- **Analysis:** Most failures indicate that the expected PKL files or the index file are not being created/found by the tests. This points towards a remaining issue within the `data_cubby.save_to_disk` logic, specifically around how paths are determined or how the final index file is written, especially when called via `plotbot` or `get_data`.
