# Captain's Log: 2025-05-03

## Major Updates

### 1. Multiplot: HAM as Right Axis Option
- Integrated HAM data as a right axis (twinx) option in multiplot.
- All right axis elements (label, ticks, tick labels, spines, and legend) now fully support rainbow color mode, matching the left axis and panel color.
- Legend label and border also colorized in rainbow mode for visual consistency.

### 2. Multiplot Examples Expanded
- Added two new HAM plot examples to `Multiplot_Examples.ipynb` to demonstrate the new right axis HAM integration and rainbow styling.

### 3. Multiplot Preset Beautification
- Improved multiplot preset settings:
    - Increased default tick length for better visibility.
    - Ensured all border, tick, and label settings are visually consistent and modern.
    - Cleaned up legend appearance and color logic.

### 4. Testing
- Ran the full stardust test suite (`tests/test_stardust.py`).
- All tests passed, confirming that multiplot, HAM integration, and all new styling features are stable.
