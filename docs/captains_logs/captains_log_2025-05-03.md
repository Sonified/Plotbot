# Captain's Log: 2025-05-03

## Major Updates

### 1. Multiplot: HAM as Right Axis Option
- Integrated HAM data as a right axis (twinx) option in multiplot.
- All right axis elements (label, ticks, tick labels, spines, and legend) now fully support rainbow color mode, matching the left axis and panel color.
- Legend label and border also colorized in rainbow mode for visual consistency.

### 2. Multiplot Examples Expanded
- Added two new HAM plot examples to `Multiplot_Examples.ipynb` to demonstrate the new right axis HAM integration and rainbow styling.

### 3. Multiplot Preset Beautification
- Improved multiplot preset settings:
    - Increased default tick length for better visibility.
    - Ensured all border, tick, and label settings are visually consistent and modern.
    - Cleaned up legend appearance and color logic.

### 4. Testing
- Ran the full stardust test suite (`tests/test_stardust.py`).
- All tests passed, confirming that multiplot, HAM integration, and all new styling features are stable.

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.10)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** feat: v1.10: Add Zarr file management test suite, document new data pipeline groundwork (2025_05_03_v1.10)
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.10
- **Git hash copied to clipboard.**
- This is now the latest version and the new mainline.

- v1.9 (HAM multiplot integration, beautified defaults) is now the mainline. 

### 5. Zarr File Management Test Suite Added
- Created `tests/test_zarr_file_io.py` to thoroughly test Zarr file read/write, directory mirroring, and CDF-to-Zarr conversion.
- Tests include:
    - Mirroring directory structure for dummy files.
    - Writing/reading single and multi-column Zarr files.
    - Importing CDF files and verifying magnetic field components.
    - Simulated PSP chunk Zarr save and reload.
    - Checking CDF file coverage and mirroring to Zarr.
- Each test prints headers and first 5 rows before/after save, and includes a note to document learnings in the captain's log.
- This suite lays the groundwork for robust Zarr-based data management in Plotbot.

### 6. Refactoring Out Legacy 'Derived' Data Class and Terminology
- Decided to remove the legacy 'derived' data class and all related code paths, as these are no longer used and have been replaced by the 'custom' variable system.
- The detailed process and rationale for this refactor are documented in `docs/refactoring_log/derived_to_custom_refactoring.py`.
- This refactor will help streamline the codebase and reduce confusion between old and new systems.
- **Next Task:** Continue searching for and removing any remaining references or 'ghosts' of the old 'derived' code to further simplify and modernize the codebase.

### 7. Next Refactoring Steps: Remove All Remaining Legacy 'derived' Code
- Begin systematically removing all remaining references and code paths related to the legacy 'derived' variable system.
- **Key files and actions:**
    - `data_cubby.py`: Remove special handling for 'derived' in `grab` and `grab_component` methods.
    - `get_data.py`: Remove the 'derived' data type check and any related comments.
    - `plot_manager.py`: Update any default plot options or metadata that still use 'derived' to use 'custom_class'/'custom_data_type' or a generic placeholder.
    - `print_manager.py`: Optionally, remove or further document legacy 'derived' debug methods and properties.
- Confirmed: `custom_variables.py` is fully decoupled from any legacy derived system.
- As each change is made, document the removal and any findings in this captain's log.

## Next Steps
- **Push these changes to the repository.**
- **Copy the git hash to clipboard after push.**
- **Review README** for any major learnings or changes to document.
- **Begin cleanup of legacy derived variable code and plan Zarr integration.**

### Recent Actions
- **Removed all legacy 'derived' variable handling from `data_cubby.py`** (grab and grab_component methods). This included special-case debug and time validation logic that is no longer used.
    - Ran `tests/test_all_plot_basics.py` after the change; all tests passed, confirming no impact on core plotting or data retrieval.
- **Removed the legacy 'derived' data type check from `get_data.py`.** This check was a vestige of the old system and is no longer needed.
    - Ran `tests/test_all_plot_basics.py` after the change; all tests passed, confirming no impact on core plotting or data retrieval.
- **Removed the last fallback and error handling for 'derived' plot_options in `plot_manager.py`.** Now, plot_manager requires explicit plot_options and will raise an error if not provided, eliminating all legacy 'derived' code paths.
    - Condensed debug prints for plot_options to a single line and improved [CUBBY] output formatting for clarity.
    - Ran `tests/test_all_plot_basics.py` and `tests/test_custom_variables.py` to confirm all changes are stable and the codebase is now fully explicit and clean regarding variable instantiation and plot options.
- **Completed the final sweep to remove all legacy 'derived' code, methods, properties, and type stubs from the codebase.** This included:
    - Purging all 'derived' debug methods, properties, and aliases from `print_manager.py` and its .pyi stub.
    - Cleaning up PLOT_ATTRIBUTES and related comments in `plot_manager.py`.
    - Updating all test and documentation language to use 'custom variable' instead of 'derived variable'.
    - Verified that no code, test, or type stub references the legacy 'derived' system.
    - Ran `tests/test_plotbot.py` and `tests/test_stardust.py`; all tests passed, confirming the codebase is now fully modernized and explicit in its custom variable handling.

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.92)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** refactor: v1.92: Remove all legacy derived code, update tests and stubs to custom variable system
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.92
- **Git hash copied to clipboard.**

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.93)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** fix: v1.93: Add missed changes from previous commit (unsaved files now included)
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.93
- **Details:** This commit includes notebook and code changes that were not saved/staged in the previous push.
- **Git hash copied to clipboard.**

### 8. Installer Script Flexibility & README Consistency Fix
- Updated `install_scripts/2_setup_env.sh` to robustly source conda from all common install locations, making the installer script portable and reliable for all users regardless of their conda setup.
- Fixed all README references to use the correct lowercase `install_scripts` folder, preventing case-sensitivity errors on macOS and Linux.
- Verified that all script-to-script calls already use the correct lowercase folder.
- No changes needed in the scripts themselves beyond the universal conda sourcing block.

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.94)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** fix: v1.94: Make installer script universally robust to conda location, fix README folder casing
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.94
- **Git hash copied to clipboard.** 

### 9. Zarr/Xarray Chunking Dependency: Dask Required (DONE)
- Discovered during the Zarr integration test suite that xarray/zarr chunking requires the 'dask' library to be installed.
- Action: Add 'dask' to both the environment (conda/pip) and requirements files to ensure all Zarr-based tests and features work out of the box.
- This will prevent ImportError: chunk manager 'dask' is not available errors during Zarr file operations. 

### 10. CDF-to-Zarr Mirroring Test: Full Success
- Ran `test6_cdf_to_zarr_mirroring` in `tests/test_zarr_file_io.py`.
- The test:
    - Found all expected CDF files for the test range.
    - Created Zarr files in `data_cubby` with perfectly mirrored paths and filenames.
    - Loaded data back from Zarr and confirmed it matches the original CDF data.
    - Verified every CDF file has a corresponding Zarr file in the mirrored structure.
- **Result:** Test passed with no errors. This proves the core Zarr file management and mirroring logic is robust and matches the intended pipeline.
- This is a major validation for the Zarr integration effort—future work can confidently build on this foundation. 

### 11. Zarr Plotbot Integration Tests 1 & 2: Passed
- **Test 1: Basic Zarr Functionality ✅ PASSED** (xarray-to-zarr roundtrip)
- **Test 2: File Structure and Chunking ✅ PASSED** (daily/6-hour cadence, directory logic)
- **Test 3: Data Class Conversion ✅ PASSED** (mock data class to xarray/zarr and back)
- **Test 3.5: plot_manager Roundtrip ✅ PASSED** (real plot_manager data and metadata survive xarray/zarr roundtrip)
    - Now includes detailed print statements for each step (creation, saving, reading, reconstruction, assertion)
    - All [ZARR] integration prints are visible and working as intended
    - Confirms end-to-end traceability for both data and metadata through the Zarr pipeline
- **Test 4: ZarrStorage Class ✅ PASSED** (tests daily chunking and multi-day retrieval only; does not test 6-hour chunking)
    - Validates daily file structure and retrieval across multiple days
    - 6-hour/sub-daily chunking logic is not covered in this test
- **Test 5: Integration with DataTracker ✅ PASSED** (Zarr storage and retrieval integrates with tracker, correctly updates and uses in-memory data)
    - All Zarr integration, tracker updates, and in-memory data logic are validated by this test
- All tests so far passed with no errors.
- Confirms Zarr install, xarray/zarr roundtrip, directory/chunking logic, and robust support for real plot_manager objects.

- Version tag: 2025_05_03_v1.95
- Commit: test: v1.95: Document CDF-to-Zarr mirroring test success, dask env update, Zarr pipeline validated (2025_05_03_v1.95)
- All Zarr/dask integration and stardust tests validated and passing.
- Closing captain's log for 2025-05-03. 

#### Push Log (2025_05_03_v1.96)
- Version tag: 2025_05_03_v1.96
- Commit: test: v1.96: Zarr integration tests 1-5 passing, end-to-end test import/circular issues remain, finally block fixed
- Tests 1-5 in test_zarr_plotbot_integration.py are passing and fully validated.
- Test 6 (end-to-end) fails due to import/circular issues with ZarrStorage; finally block now robust to early failures. 

### 12. Data Class Name Consistency Check
- We are confirming that all `class_instance_name` entries in `plotbot/data_classes/psp_data_types.py` match the actual class definitions in the data_classes folder.
- Here are the current mappings:
    - mag_RTN: mag_rtn ✅
    - mag_RTN_4sa: mag_rtn_4sa ✅
    - mag_SC: mag_sc ✅
    - mag_SC_4sa: mag_sc_4sa ✅
    - spe_sf0_pad: epad ✅
    - spe_af0_pad: epad_hr ✅
    - spi_sf00_l3_mom: proton ✅
    - spi_af00_L3_mom: proton_hr ✅
    - sf00_fits: proton_fits ✅
    - sf01_fits: alpha_fits ✅
    - ham: ham ✅
- Next: Check that each of these names matches a class in the data_classes folder for consistency and reliability.

- Audit Result (2025-05-03):
    - Each `class_instance_name` in the mapping was checked against the `class_name` used in the `ploptions` for the corresponding class in the data_classes folder.
    - All mappings are correct: the `class_instance_name` matches the `class_name` used in plot_manager/ploptions assignments for each class.
    - This confirms that the mapping is reliable for both data_cubby registration and plotting logic.
    - No mismatches or inconsistencies found. ✅ 

### 13. End-to-End Test for Zarr Integration - Challenges & Solutions
- **Issue 1: Circular Imports in get_data.py**
  - Identified a circular import issue involving the ZarrStorage class and plotbot config access.
  - Fixed by importing the plotbot module as 'pb' consistently across the file and avoiding nested imports.
  - Local imports of 'plotbot' within function scope were causing namespace confusion and variable shadowing.

- **Issue 2: Data Directory Structure**
  - Updated ZarrStorage to use './data_cubby' as the default base directory instead of './zarr_storage'.
  - Modified the end-to-end test to work with the actual data_cubby directory rather than a temporary test directory.
  - This ensures consistency with existing file structure and prevents path confusion.

- **Issue 3: Date Format Consistency**
  - Identified inconsistent date format usage between tests and real-world code.
  - Standardized on using the format '2022/06/01 22:30:00.000' for time ranges in tests.
  - This matches the format used in production notebooks and avoids parsing errors.

- **Issue 4: Download Process Visibility**
  - Added extensive debug prints to trace the data download and processing flow.
  - Identified that the end-to-end test is correctly set up, but the underlying data download system is failing silently.
  - Both berkeley_download and spdf_download are failing to retrieve expected magnetic field data.

- **Next Actions:**
  - Check the berkeley/spdf server URLs and authentication status.
  - Verify Berkeley data access credentials and endpoints.
  - Add additional logging to data_download_berkeley.py module to trace request/response cycle.
  - Consider refactoring the data download system to include more robust error handling and status reporting.

## Zarr Integration Debugging Notes (2025-05-03)

I see what's happening now. Looking at your debug output shows two critical issues:

### Issue 1: Zarr Compression Error
```
[ZARR] [store_data] Exception: module 'zarr' has no attribute 'Blosc'
```

This is a dependency issue. The code is trying to use `zarr.Blosc` for compression, but your installed zarr version doesn't have this attribute. This is why we can't store data properly.

### Issue 2: Multidimensional Array Handling
```
[ZARR] [store_data] Exception: Variable 'strahl': Could not convert tuple...
```

The system can't properly handle 2D arrays like `strahl` with shape (1545, 12) when creating Variables.

### Root Problem

The flow looks like this:
1. `get_data` is called with correct parameters
2. The data types aren't being correctly identified (notice `required_data_types: set()` is empty!)
3. No data is actually downloaded, but the function claims success
4. The class instance exists but has no data (`datetime_array is None`)

I understand your concern about "flying fast and loose." Let's take a step back and fix this properly:

1. **Fix the Zarr compression issue**:
   ```python
   # Replace in zarr_storage.py
   encoding = {var: {'compressor': zarr.Blosc(cname='zstd', clevel=5, shuffle=2)} 
               for var in ds.data_vars}
   
   # With this safer version:
   encoding = {var: {} for var in ds.data_vars}  # No compression initially
   ```

2. **Fix the data type detection** in `get_data.py`:
   ```python
   # Debug the required_data_types issue
   print(f"Variable type: {type(variables[0])}, name: {getattr(variables[0], '__name__', 'unknown')}")
   ```

The critical thing to understand is that `get_data` isn't even recognizing `mag_rtn_4sa` as a valid data type, which is why nothing's being downloaded or processed.

Let's fix these fundamentals before worrying about the data conversion. The empty `required_data_types` set is the smoking gun here.

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.98)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** v1.98: Working version, all tests pass, but Zarr is slow for EPAD data (2025_05_03_v1.98)
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.98
- **Details:**
    - All core and end-to-end tests pass, including Zarr roundtrip and plotting for EPAD.
    - Zarr storage and reload is robust for all data types, but performance is slow for large 2D EPAD arrays (Zarr is not faster than CDF on first load).
    - This version is stable and ready for further optimization or profiling of Zarr performance for spectral data.
- **Git hash will be copied to clipboard after push.**

## Version Control Update (2025_05_03_v1.99)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** v1.99: Mesh saving version—direct meshgrid storage for fast Zarr loading (2025_05_03_v1.99)
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_03_v1.99
- **Details:**
    - Both times_mesh and pitch_mesh are now always stored in Zarr and loaded directly if present, eliminating meshgrid reconstruction overhead.
    - Zarr loading for spectral data is now robust and nearly as fast as CDF import.

## 2025-05-04 Version Update

- **Version:** 2025_05_04_v2.00
- **Commit Message:** v2.00: Zarr time coverage logic is still flawed—this version does NOT reliably use Zarr cache if file boundaries don't exactly match request (2025_05_04_v2.00). Needs further work.
- **Summary:**
    - Incremented version to v2.00.
    - Updated commit message and version printouts to reflect that Zarr loading logic is still flawed: this version does NOT reliably use the Zarr cache if the file boundaries do not exactly match the requested time range, even if the data fully encompasses the request.
    - This version documents the flaw and signals that further work is needed to make Zarr time coverage robust.

---

## Version Control Update (2025_05_04_v2.01)
- **Pushed to main branch.**
- **Commit Message:** v2.01: Fix Zarr meshgrid dtype bug for EPAD strahl—now stores meshgrid as numeric seconds for matplotlib compatibility.
- **Version Tag:** 2025_05_04_v2.01
- **Details:**
    - Fixed a persistent bug where meshgrid arrays (times_mesh) loaded from Zarr were not compatible with matplotlib's pcolormesh due to dtype issues (datetime or string instead of numeric seconds).
    - Now, after loading from Zarr, meshgrids are reconstructed using numeric seconds since start, ensuring compatibility with matplotlib.
    - This preserves the design philosophy: calculation results are stored and not recalculated at plot time.
    - Updated version and commit message in both __init__.py and plotbot.py to reflect this fix.
- **Git hash will be copied to clipboard after push.**

Closed!
