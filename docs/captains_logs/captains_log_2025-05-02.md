## Multiplot Test Organization and Spacing Improvements

Today we focused on improving the organization of our multiplot tests and fixing spacing issues between plot panels.

### Changes Made

1. **Test Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `multiplot_tests` directory inside the tests folder
   - Moved all related test files into this new subdirectory
   - Updated import paths in all moved test files
   - Added proper `__init__.py` to make the directory a proper Python package

2. **Improved Plot Spacing in Multiplot**
   - Added smarter spacing between plot panels when using individual titles
   - Fixed the spacing logic to respect user settings
     - Created a `_user_set_hspace` property to track when users explicitly set hspace
   - Made individual titles bold for better visibility
   - Increased default spacing (hspace) from 0.35 to 0.65 for panels with multipl titles

3. **Fixed Spectral Data Plotting Bug**
   - Fixed a critical bug in multiplot's spectral data plotting
   - Removed incorrect data transposition in pcolormesh call
   - Added better error handling for dimension mismatches
   - Ensured consistent behavior with plotbot_main.py's implementation
   - This fixes strahl spectrogram display in multiplot

### Technical Details

- The new spacing system avoids confusing behavior where certain values would trigger unexpected jumps
- Added smart detection for user-set values using Python's inspection capabilities
- Built this in a way that doesn't interfere with other settings or presets

This refactoring improves both code organization and visual appearance of plots, particularly when using individual titles for each panel.

## Major Learning: Multiplot, HAM Data, and Per-Panel Variable Updates

While testing multiplot's new HAM data integration, we discovered a subtle but important architectural detail:

- **Multiplot updates variables in the plot_list for each panel's time range by calling get_data and refreshing the reference from data_cubby.**
- **However, plt.options.ham_var is a global option, not part of the plot_list.**
- As a result, multiplot does NOT automatically update ham_var for each panel's time range. It only uses whatever is in ham_var at the time multiplot is called.
- This means: if you load HAM data for multiple time ranges before calling multiplot, only the most recently loaded data will be available, and only the last panel will show HAM data.

### Implications
- This is different from how main variables are handled, and can be surprising for users.
- For robust multiplot+HAM support, multiplot should be refactored to call get_data for ham_var for each panel's time range, just like it does for the main variable.
- For now, tests should be written with this limitation in mind, and users should be aware that only the last panel will show HAM data unless multiplot is refactored.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider refactoring multiplot to handle ham_var per panel, or document this limitation for users and test writers.

## Version Information
- Version: 2025_05_02_v1.181
- Commit Message: "feat: Document multiplot HAM integration learnings and clarify per-panel data handling (2025_05_02_v1.181)"

*Note: This is a partial increment (.001) as this update documents learnings and limitations, not a full feature or bugfix.*

## Multiplot HAM Integration: Automated Testing & New Controls (2025_05_02_v1.182)

Today we completed a robust, automated test suite for multiplot's HAM integration, and added new user controls for HAM plotting:

### New Controls for Multiplot HAM Functionality
- `plt.options.hamify = True`  # Enable plotting HAM data on the right axis
- `plt.options.ham_var = ham_instance.hamogram_30s`  # Choose which HAM variable to plot (e.g., hamogram_30s, hamogram_2m, hamogram_20m, etc.)
- `plt.options.ham_opacity = 0.5`  # Set HAM plot transparency (0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque)
- You can also set the color of the HAM variable directly, e.g. `ham_var.color = 'red'`

### Automated Test Output
- Added a comprehensive test (`test_multiplot_ham_extended_variants`) that generates multiplots for March 19–27, 2025, ±12 hours around noon, for all major HAM plotting scenarios.
- All plots are saved (not displayed) in `tests/multiplot_ham_tests/` with clear numeric and descriptive filenames:
    - `1_standard.png` (default color, default opacity, hamogram_30s)
    - `2_rainbow.png` (rainbow color mode, hamogram_30s)
    - `3_rainbow_50pct.png` (rainbow, ham at 50% opacity, hamogram_30s)
    - `4_rainbow_75pct.png` (rainbow, ham at 75% opacity, hamogram_30s)
    - `5_rainbow_2m_50pct.png` (rainbow, ham at 50% opacity, hamogram_2m)
    - `6_rainbow_20m_50pct_red.png` (rainbow, ham at 50% opacity, hamogram_20m, red)
- The matplotlib 'Agg' backend is now set for all tests, ensuring headless, non-interactive operation (no GUI popups).

### Version Information
- Version: 2025_05_02_v1.182
- Commit Message: "test: Add multiplot HAM integration test suite, new user controls, and headless plotting (2025_05_02_v1.182)"

*Note: This is a partial increment (.001) as this update documents learnings and limitations, not a full feature or bugfix.*

## Multiplot Plot Size and Layout Settings (as of 2025-05-02)

**Current configuration and logic for multiplot plot sizing and layout:**

- **Default width:** 22 inches (set in MultiplotOptions.reset as self.width = 22)
- **Default height per panel:** 3 inches (self.height_per_panel = 3)
- **Default DPI:** 300 (used in most figure creation unless otherwise specified)
- **No manual margins:** All margin logic (top, bottom, left, right, hspace) has been removed. All plots use `constrained_layout=True` so matplotlib handles all spacing.
- **Presets:** If a preset is set (e.g., VERTICAL_POSTER_MEDIUM), it only affects figure size, DPI, and font sizes—not margins.
- **use_default_plot_settings:**
    - If `True`, multiplot does NOT set any options or presets and uses matplotlib's built-in defaults for everything (including figure size, which is 6.4 x 4.8 inches by default).
    - If `False`, multiplot uses whatever is set in pbplt.options (after reset, this is width=22, height_per_panel=3, etc.).
- **Test script:** The margin test script currently runs both modes for each panel count, saving output as `...default_True.png` and `...default_False.png` and including the mode in the plot title.
- **Key learning:** The visual difference between modes is due to the default width (22 inches) vs. matplotlib's default (6.4 inches). No other customizations are active unless explicitly set.

**To restore this configuration:**
- Use `pbplt.options.reset()` to get width=22, height_per_panel=3, and all other defaults.
- Do not set any manual margins or hspace.
- Use `constrained_layout=True` in all multiplot figure creation.
- For pure matplotlib defaults, set `use_default_plot_settings=True` and do not set any other options.

## Outstanding Issue: Multiplot Right Axis Color Consistency (as of 2025-05-02)

**Goal:**
Ensure that in multiplot, the right y-axis (HAM overlay) tick labels, ticks, and all spines (borders) match the panel color (rainbow), not black.

**What's Been Tried:**
- Set the right y-axis label, tick color, and spine color to the panel color after plotting HAM data.
- Used `ax2.tick_params(axis='y', colors=panel_color, which='both')` and set all `ax2.spines` to `panel_color`.
- The right axis label color is fixed, but the tick labels, ticks, and borders are still black in some cases.

**Next Steps:**
- On reboot, re-examine the order of operations and check for any code that might override the axis color after it's set.
- Focus on ensuring all right axis elements (label, ticks, tick labels, spines) are colored correctly and consistently with the rainbow color scheme.
