## Multiplot Test Organization and Spacing Improvements

Today we focused on improving the organization of our multiplot tests and fixing spacing issues between plot panels.

### Changes Made

1. **Test Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `multiplot_tests` directory inside the tests folder
   - Moved all related test files into this new subdirectory
   - Updated import paths in all moved test files
   - Added proper `__init__.py` to make the directory a proper Python package

2. **Improved Plot Spacing in Multiplot**
   - Added smarter spacing between plot panels when using individual titles
   - Fixed the spacing logic to respect user settings
     - Created a `_user_set_hspace` property to track when users explicitly set hspace
   - Made individual titles bold for better visibility
   - Increased default spacing (hspace) from 0.35 to 0.65 for panels with multipl titles

3. **Fixed Spectral Data Plotting Bug**
   - Fixed a critical bug in multiplot's spectral data plotting
   - Removed incorrect data transposition in pcolormesh call
   - Added better error handling for dimension mismatches
   - Ensured consistent behavior with plotbot_main.py's implementation
   - This fixes strahl spectrogram display in multiplot

### Technical Details

- The new spacing system avoids confusing behavior where certain values would trigger unexpected jumps
- Added smart detection for user-set values using Python's inspection capabilities
- Built this in a way that doesn't interfere with other settings or presets

This refactoring improves both code organization and visual appearance of plots, particularly when using individual titles for each panel.

## Major Learning: Multiplot, HAM Data, and Per-Panel Variable Updates

While testing multiplot's new HAM data integration, we discovered a subtle but important architectural detail:

- **Multiplot updates variables in the plot_list for each panel's time range by calling get_data and refreshing the reference from data_cubby.**
- **However, plt.options.ham_var is a global option, not part of the plot_list.**
- As a result, multiplot does NOT automatically update ham_var for each panel's time range. It only uses whatever is in ham_var at the time multiplot is called.
- This means: if you load HAM data for multiple time ranges before calling multiplot, only the most recently loaded data will be available, and only the last panel will show HAM data.

### Implications
- This is different from how main variables are handled, and can be surprising for users.
- For robust multiplot+HAM support, multiplot should be refactored to call get_data for ham_var for each panel's time range, just like it does for the main variable.
- For now, tests should be written with this limitation in mind, and users should be aware that only the last panel will show HAM data unless multiplot is refactored.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider refactoring multiplot to handle ham_var per panel, or document this limitation for users and test writers.

## Version Information
- Version: 2025_05_02_v1.181
- Commit Message: "feat: Document multiplot HAM integration learnings and clarify per-panel data handling (2025_05_02_v1.181)"

*Note: This is a partial increment (.001) as this update documents learnings and limitations, not a full feature or bugfix.*
