## Multiplot Test Organization and Spacing Improvements

Today we focused on improving the organization of our multiplot tests and fixing spacing issues between plot panels.

### Changes Made

1. **Test Organization**
   - Created a dedicated `multiplot_tests` directory inside the tests folder
   - Moved all related test files into this new subdirectory
   - Updated import paths in all moved test files
   - Added proper `__init__.py` to make the directory a proper Python package

2. **Improved Plot Spacing in Multiplot**
   - Added smarter spacing between plot panels when using individual titles
   - Fixed the spacing logic to respect user settings
     - Created a `_user_set_hspace` property to track when users explicitly set hspace
   - Made individual titles bold for better visibility
   - Increased default spacing (hspace) from 0.35 to 0.65 for panels with multipl titles

3. **Fixed Spectral Data Plotting Bug**
   - Fixed a critical bug in multiplot's spectral data plotting
   - Removed incorrect data transposition in pcolormesh call
   - Added better error handling for dimension mismatches
   - Ensured consistent behavior with plotbot_main.py's implementation
   - This fixes strahl spectrogram display in multiplot

### Technical Details

- The new spacing system avoids confusing behavior where certain values would trigger unexpected jumps
- Added smart detection for user-set values using Python's inspection capabilities
- Built this in a way that doesn't interfere with other settings or presets

This refactoring improves both code organization and visual appearance of plots, particularly when using individual titles for each panel.
