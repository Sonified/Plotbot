## Bug Fix & Refactor: `data_type` Attribute Initialization

- **Issue:** A recurring error, `'data_type' is not a recognized attribute, friend!`, was observed. This typically occurred when methods like `update` or `__getattr__` were called on data class instances where the `data_type` attribute had not yet been set.
- **Root Cause:** The `data_type` attribute, while intended to be a core identifier for data classes, was not being explicitly initialized in the `__init__` method of several classes. Access attempts before it was dynamically set (e.g., during an update operation or by some other mechanism) would lead to an `AttributeError`.
- **Fix Implemented:**
    - Added explicit initialization of the `data_type` attribute in the `__init__` method for all affected data classes. This was done using `object.__setattr__(self, 'data_type', 'your_data_type_string_here')` to ensure the attribute is set when an instance is created.
    - Affected classes and their initialized `data_type` strings:
        - `plotbot/data_classes/psp_proton_classes.py`:
            - `proton_class`: `'spi_sf00_l3_mom'`
            - `proton_hr_class`: `'spi_af00_l3_mom'`
        - `plotbot/data_classes/psp_proton_fits_classes.py`:
            - `proton_fits_class`: `'psp_fld_l3_sf0_fit'`
        - `plotbot/data_classes/psp_alpha_fits_classes.py`:
            - `alpha_fits_class`: `'psp_fld_l3_sf1_fit'`
        - `plotbot/data_classes/psp_electron_classes.py`:
            - `epad_strahl_class`: `'spe_sf0_pad'`
            - `epad_strahl_high_res_class`: `'spe_hires_pad'`
        - `plotbot/data_classes/psp_ham_classes.py`:
            - `ham_class`: `'ham'`
- **Learning:** Ensured that essential identifying attributes like `data_type` are initialized directly in `__init__` to prevent `AttributeError` issues, especially when complex attribute access patterns (like those in `__getattr__` or instance update methods) are involved.

## Push: v2.31

- **Version Tag:** `2025_05_12_v2.31`
- **Commit Message:** `Fix: Initialize data_type in data classes to resolve attribute errors (v2.31)`
- **Summary:** Addressed attribute errors by explicitly initializing `data_type` in all relevant data classes (`psp_proton_classes`, `psp_proton_fits_classes`, `psp_alpha_fits_classes`, `psp_electron_classes`, `psp_ham_classes`).
