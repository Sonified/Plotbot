# Captain's Log - 2025-04-23

**Session Summary:**

Focused on updating the project's core dependencies and installation process, and adding a test to verify the environment integrity.

**Key Activities & Updates:**

1.  **Dependency Updates:**
    *   Added `pyspedas` (via pip) and `ipympl` to `environment.yml` to support future pyspedas integration and interactive matplotlib widgets.
    *   Confirmed `ipywidgets`, `pytest`, and `termcolor` were already correctly included.
2.  **README Update:**
    *   Updated the "Required Versions" section in `README.md` to reflect the added dependencies (`pyspedas`, `ipympl`) and their purposes.
3.  **Installer Script Enhancement:**
    *   Modified `Install_Scripts/2_setup_env.sh` to provide more verbose output during environment updates (`conda env update -v`).
    *   Troubleshot and resolved issues with the script failing to display conda errors by allowing direct terminal output.
4.  **New Test Added:**
    *   Created `tests/test_package_dependencies.py` to perform a "smoke test" on the environment.
    *   Phase 1: Verifies that all essential packages listed in `environment.yml` can be imported.
    *   Phase 2: Performs a basic usage check for each imported package (e.g., creating an array, checking a version, making a simple call).
    *   Renamed the test file from `test_dependencies.py` for improved clarity.
5.  **Log Management:**
    *   Closed previous logs (`2025_04_21`, `2025_04_20`) with a simple "LOG CLOSED" note.
