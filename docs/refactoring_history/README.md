# Refactoring History

This directory contains documentation of significant refactoring efforts in the Plotbot codebase.

## Contents

- `derived_to_custom_refactoring.py` - Documentation of the terminology change from "derived" to "custom" variables throughout the codebase (March 2024)

## Purpose

The files in this directory serve as historical documentation of major architectural and terminology changes. They are preserved to:

1. Explain the reasoning behind significant design changes
2. Document the implementation process and strategies used
3. Provide context for future developers about why certain design decisions were made
4. Serve as reference material for similar refactoring efforts in the future

These files are not active code or tests, but rather historical artifacts that provide valuable context about the evolution of the codebase.
