    <h1>Plotbot's Kitchen: The EPAD Strahl Double Mystery – Stale Timetables & Vanishing Pitch Angles</h1>

    <p>Alright, Chef Robert, let's sift through the ashes of that recent kitchen fire. It's incredibly frustrating when a recipe that's been reliable for ages suddenly explodes. This <code>epad.strahl</code> issue when plotting adjacent time ranges was a particularly sneaky one, hitting us with a one-two punch.</p>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h3>The Initial Order & The First Sign of Trouble</h3>
        <p>You asked for two servings of <code>epad.strahl</code>: <code>TRANGE_1</code>, then an immediately adjacent <code>TRANGE_2</code>.
        The first plot (<code>TRANGE_1</code>) came out perfectly. The second (<code>TRANGE_2</code>) was alarmingly empty. No data visible, even though we knew the ingredients were fetched.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Part 1: The Mystery of the Stale Timetable</h2>
    <p>Our first investigation focused on why <code>TRANGE_2</code> data wasn't appearing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Clues:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Expediter (<code>get_data</code>) was correctly fetching raw <code>epad</code> ingredients for <code>TRANGE_2</code>.</li>
                <li>The <code>DataCubby</code> (our central ingredient organizer) was also doing its job, taking the new <code>TRANGE_2</code> ingredients and merging them with the existing <code>TRANGE_1</code> data in the main <code>epad</code> station (the global <code>epad_strahl_class</code> instance). The <code>datetime_array</code> and <code>raw_data['strahl']</code> on this global instance correctly spanned both time ranges.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>The Culprit:</strong> The <code>times_mesh</code> attribute within the global <code>epad</code> instance. This attribute is like a detailed 2D timetable or coordinate grid that <code>pcolormesh</code> uses to draw the spectral plot. After <code>DataCubby</code> merged the <code>datetime_array</code> (the 1D list of all times) and <code>raw_data['strahl']</code> (the actual data values), the <code>times_mesh</code> was <em>not</em> being updated or regenerated. It still only contained the timetable for <code>TRANGE_1</code>.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> When the <code>epad</code> instance's <code>set_ploptions()</code> method was called to prepare for plotting <code>TRANGE_2</code>, it used this stale <code>times_mesh</code> (covering only <code>TRANGE_1</code>) to configure the <code>plot_manager</code> for the <code>strahl</code> component. So, when <code>plotbot_main.py</code> tried to render the plot for <code>TRANGE_2</code>, the underlying plot manager effectively had no coordinates for that period, resulting in an empty display.</p>

    <div class="solution">
        <h3>The Fix (Part 1): Always Serve with a Fresh Timetable</h3>
        <p>We modified the <code>epad_strahl_class.set_ploptions()</code> method. Now, before it configures the <code>plot_manager</code> for the <code>strahl</code> component, it explicitly checks if <code>self.times_mesh</code> is consistent with the current <code>self.datetime_array</code> and <code>self.raw_data['strahl']</code>. If there's a mismatch (which there would be after <code>DataCubby</code>'s merge), it regenerates <code>self.times_mesh</code> using the fresh, combined data. This ensures the plot always gets an up-to-date timetable.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Part 2: The Mystery of the Vanishing Pitch Angles</h2>
    <p>With the timetable fixed, we reran the test. The second plot started to show... and then, BAM! An <code>IndexError: index X is out of bounds for axis 0 with size Y</code>. The kitchen was still smoldering!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Clues:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The error originated in <code>plotbot_main.py</code> during the spectral plotting section, specifically when trying to slice <code>var.additional_data[time_indices]</code>.</li>
                <li>For <code>epad.strahl</code>, <code>var.additional_data</code> is where the <code>pitch_angle</code> array is passed.</li>
                <li>The <code>time_indices</code> correctly reflected the full merged time range (e.g., 0 to 37077).</li>
                <li>However, the <code>pitch_angle</code> array (<code>var.additional_data</code>) still had the dimensions from only the first time range (e.g., 12359 time points). It hadn't grown with the rest of the data!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>The Culprit:</strong> The <code>pitch_angle</code> data was stored as a direct attribute (<code>self.pitch_angle</code>) on the <code>epad_strahl_class</code> instance. <code>DataCubby</code>'s merging logic is primarily designed to handle the <code>datetime_array</code> and the contents of the <code>raw_data</code> dictionary (which it expects to be NumPy arrays that can be concatenated). It had no specific instructions or mechanism to find and merge this separate <code>self.pitch_angle</code> attribute.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>The Consequence:</strong> When plotting the merged data, the code expected <code>pitch_angle</code> to have the same number of time points as the merged <code>datetime_array</code> (e.g., 37078). But since <code>pitch_angle</code> was stuck at its original size (e.g., 12359), any attempt to access an index beyond its bounds (like <code>pitch_angle[12359]</code> or higher) caused the <code>IndexError</code>.</p>

    <div class="solution">
        <h3>The Fix (Part 2): Bring All Ingredients to the Main Prep Table</h3>
        <p>We refactored <code>epad_strahl_class</code> (and its high-resolution twin, <code>epad_strahl_high_res_class</code>). The crucial change was moving the pitch angle data from a direct attribute (<code>self.pitch_angle</code>) into the <code>self.raw_data</code> dictionary, under a new key like <code>'pitch_angle_y_values'</code>.</p>
        <p>Why did this work? Because <code>DataCubby._merge_arrays</code> is already built to iterate through the keys of the <code>raw_data</code> dictionary and attempt to concatenate the corresponding NumPy arrays from the old and new data segments. By making pitch angle data a standard item in <code>raw_data</code>, it automatically got included in this existing, robust merging process.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>But Why Did It Work Flawlessly Before and Break So Suddenly?</h2>
    <p>This is the million-dollar question, and often the most frustrating part of debugging. Here are some likely scenarios for why this "time bomb" went off now:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Latent Bug Hypothesis:</strong> The underlying logic for handling <code>pitch_angle</code> during merges was likely always flawed (or rather, non-existent for a direct attribute). It's possible that previous test cases or typical usage patterns didn't trigger the exact sequence of:
            <ul>
                <li>Loading <code>epad.strahl</code> for one time range.</li>
                <li>Then loading an *adjacent* time range that forced a <code>DataCubby</code> merge.</li>
                <li>Then attempting to plot this merged <code>epad.strahl</code>, which would require the <code>pitch_angle</code> data to also have been merged.</li>
            </ul>
            Perhaps previous scenarios involved non-adjacent ranges (less likely to merge in the same way) or single large ranges.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unrelated Change Elsewhere Exposed the Flaw:</strong> Sometimes, a change in a completely different part of the system can alter execution flow or data states just enough to expose a pre-existing weakness. For instance:
            <ul>
                <li>If there were subtle changes to how <code>DataCubby</code> decides to merge versus fully reload data.</li>
                <li>If <code>DataTracker</code>'s logic changed, leading to more merge scenarios.</li>
                <li>Even a change in how data was initialized or pre-loaded could have masked the issue before.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The "It Just Happened to Work" Syndrome:</strong> In complex systems, sometimes things align by chance. The previous way <code>pitch_angle</code> was handled might have accidentally worked in most common cases because the data happened to be of a compatible shape or because the plotting code didn't always stress the mismatched dimensions until a specific sequence like our adjacent plot test.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>The key takeaway is that the previous setup was fragile.</strong> Relying on <code>DataCubby</code> to magically understand and correctly merge a direct attribute like <code>self.pitch_angle</code>, without explicit instructions for it, was an oversight. The current fix—integrating <code>pitch_angle</code> into the <code>raw_data</code> structure that <code>DataCubby</code> is designed to handle—makes the data management far more explicit and robust.</p>

    <div class="solution">
        <h3>The Kitchen is (Hopefully) Calmer Now</h3>
        <p>By ensuring <code>times_mesh</code> is always freshly generated for the current data and by making <code>pitch_angle</code> a first-class citizen within the <code>raw_data</code> merging process, the plotting of <code>epad.strahl</code> for adjacent (and merged) time ranges should now be stable and reliable. While the "why now?" can be maddening, the "why it's fixed" is rooted in clearer, more robust data handling principles. We've reinforced the foundations of this particular recipe!</p>
