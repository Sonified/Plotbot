Subject: Debug notebook for EPAD data path issue

Hey,

I created a diagnostic notebook to help track down why the epad data isn't showing up for you.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open: tests/debug_epad_data_paths.ipynb
2. Run Cell 1 (imports)
3. Run Cell 2 (diagnostics)
4. Copy ALL the output from Cell 2
5. Send it back to me

This will tell us:
- Where Plotbot is looking for the data
- Whether PySpedas thinks it downloaded anything
- If any epad files exist anywhere on your system
- Why the Berkeley fallback isn't triggering

The whole output should be one continuous block you can copy-paste.

Thanks!
